Are decorative magnets on refrigerator dangerous?,You have good reason to think this sounds absurd, because, well, this is absurd. The answer to your question is unequivocally, "no!"

The first warning signs:


Grammatical/typographic/formatting errors in the warning itself.
Asking to "Kindly pass this information to your contacts." - Eric Idle said it best, spam spam spam spam.
The misnomer of calling what should be "irradiated" food "radiated" food. Radiated food would just be food emitted from someone or something, which would be a great idea for a super-power...
If this was a legitimate study, it would be groundbreaking, and would be receiving enormous media attention. Just think about how many official studies and media buzzes one encounters (and how many questions have been asked on this site) regarding cell phone radiation and health. Wouldn't this be an even bigger bombshell?


To put a little actual backbone into it, though, check out this site; it does a nice job at quickly and simply debunking this.

To summarize the finer points of the above link:


Check out Princeton's research page - you won't find it there!
The author claims to have contacted Princeton about this, and received the following reply from a spokesperson (granted, without seeing an email, this is just as specious as the claim itself):


  To confirm, we are not aware of any such research affiliated with anyone at Princeton and unfortunately we do not know where or why this e-mail chain started.
  
  We appreciate you informing your readers that this e-mail is a hoax.

Don't forget, how do you think refrigerator doors stick when closed? Magnets! Furthermore, many electric motors (like the one that makes refrigerators work) generate electric and magnetic fields on their own - certainly larger than the miniscule one produced by a refrigerator magnet.
The above site also links to the National Cancer Institute, a great source for this kind of information. Looking at this linked page, one can see (with regard to humans):


  No consistent association between magnetic fields and leukemia or brain tumors has been established.


And to follow up on the whole mouse thing:


  Animal studies have not found that magnetic field exposure is associated with increased risk of cancer (2). The absence of animal data supporting carcinogenicity makes it biologically less likely that magnetic field exposures in humans, at home or at work, are linked to increased cancer risk.



So no. There is nothing to worry about with refrigerator magnets. Unless you eat them. That might be a problem.

(I also think a fair name for this whole fiasco could be: decorative magnets, how do they work!?)

Are most cases of polio derived from the polio vaccine?,Numbers not exact, ratio plausible. This is a success story.

The WHO provides a queryable database on AFP / polio. I am a bit unclear on the exact meaning of the headers, so I'll list the 2017 global totals for all columns:


AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases: 104090  
Non polio AFP Rate: 5.46
% Adequate stool collection: 89  
Pending: 118 
Wild poliovirus cases: 22
cVDPV cases: 96
Compatibles: 259 


cVDPV stands for circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus.

So 96 cVDPV cases to 22 wild cases with 118 "pending" at least makes the claim's 21 to 6 cases plausible (assuming "at the point of writing").



This graph visualizes the progress of polio eradication: 



(Tobus, Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0)



Note that cVDPV does not mean that the vaccinated person becomes ill. It means that viruses shedded by a freshly vaccinated person start infecting other, unvaccinated people. A fully vaccinated population would be immune from both types of polio.

Quoted from the WHO page, emphasis mine:


  It takes a long time for a cVDPV to occur. Generally, the strain will have been allowed to circulate in an un- or under-immunized population for a period of at least 12 months. Circulating VDPVs occur when routine or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are poorly conducted and a population is left susceptible to poliovirus, whether from vaccine-derived or wild poliovirus. Hence, the problem is not with the vaccine itself, but low vaccination coverage. If a population is fully immunized, they will be protected against both vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses.
  
  Since 2000, more than 10 billion doses of OPV have been administered to nearly 3 billion children worldwide. As a result, more than 13 million cases of polio have been prevented, and the disease has been reduced by more than 99%. During that time, 24 cVDPV outbreaks occurred in 21 countries, resulting in fewer than 760 VDPV cases.


Actually they felt they could remove the most problematic strain of the virus from the vaccination:


  Until 2015, over 90% of cVDPV cases were due to the type 2 component in OPV. With the transmission of wild poliovirus type 2 already successfully interrupted since 1999, in April 2016 a switch was implemented from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV in routine immunization programmes. The removal of the type 2 component of OPV is associated with significant public health benefits, including a reduction of the risk of cases of cVDPV2.


So allowing for the latency mentioned for cVDPV to actually occur, vaccine-derived polio cases can be expected to go down as well.

Are sea salt soaks beneficial for healing a body piercing?,I found this review in The Cochrane Library - Water for wound cleansing

This is the Plain Language Summary:


  Water is frequently used for cleaning wounds to prevent infection. This can be tap water, distilled water, cooled boiled water or saline
  (salty water). Using tap water to cleanse acute wounds in adults does not increase the infection rate, however, there is no strong evidence
  that cleansing per se is better than not cleansing. The reviewers concluded that where tap water is high quality (drinkable), it may be
  as good as other methods such as sterile water or saline (salty) water (and more cost-effective), but more research is needed.

Is the hydrogen peroxide therapy harmful?,Concentrated Hydrogen peroxide solutions (MSDS from Merck for a 30% solution) are strongly oxidizing and corrosive. Those should only be handled with proper safety procedures and euqipment (especially safety glasses). 

The Emergency overview from the MSDS states:


  DANGER! OXIDIZER. CONTACT WITH OTHER
  MATERIAL MAY CAUSE FIRE. CAUSES
  RESPIRATORY TRACT, EYE AND SKIN BURNS.
  HARMFUL IF INHALED OR SWALLOWED. MAY
  BE HARMFUL IF ABSORBED THROUGH SKIN.
  CONTAINS MATERIAL WHICH MAY CAUSE
  DAMAGE TO THE FOLLOWING ORGANS: MUCOUS
  MEMBRANES, RESPIRATORY TRACT, SKIN,
  EYE, LENS OR CORNEA, NOSE, SINUSES.


Lower concentrated solutions (around 3-8% H2O2) are used to bleach hair, that should give you an idea that this is a pretty reactive chemical. 

The Hong Kong Center for Food safety says the following about ingesting highly diluted solutions of hydrogen peroxide


  Oral ingestion of 3% hydrogen peroxide
  solutions (household strength)
  generally does not result in severe
  toxicity but may result in vomiting,
  mild irritation to mucosa and burns in
  the mouth, throat, oesophagus and
  stomach. Ingestion of higher
  concentration, e.g. >10%, can result
  in more dangerous sequelae such as
  burns to mucus membranes and gut
  mucosa.


I would guess that the therapy you asked about uses far lower concentrations of H2O2 than 3 percent, because the higher concentrations are likely to cause some unwanted effects. Whether the ingestion is really dangerous depends strongly on the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide solution. I personally wouldn't ingest it in any case, but if it a very highly diluted solution it probably doesn't do much of anything.

I would be worried about handling higher concentrated H2O2 solutions, e.g. if they add concentrated H2O2 to the water themselves, they have to be careful when handling it.

Is sitting dangerous?,As it turns out, sitting for long periods of time seems to be associated with many adverse side effects.  


The University of South Carolina did a study on the effects long-term sitting has on cardiovascular health. They found that over a period of 21 years, men who reported being sedentary for more than 23 hours per week had a 64% greater risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.
NPR commented on another study done by Northwestern University where the amount of exercise did not offset the damage done by sitting for long periods of time. Surprisingly,



  ...for people 60 and older, each additional hour a day spent sitting increases the risk of becoming physically disabled by about 50 percent — no matter how much exercise they get.



Another study by Toronto Rehab, later published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that



  the amount of time a person sits during the day is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and death, regardless of regular exercise


So what can we do about this if exercise does not seem to help? The key seems to be breaking up long periods of sitting with short, intermittent periods of activity. 

The University of Missouri says that 10 minutes of walking after a long period of sitting is enough to reverse the vascular damage caused by inactivity.

As a parting thought, in their question, DeVil said:


  ...I can agree that the human body wasn't designed to sit down for 8+ hours a day. But if I eat healthy and still go to the gym three times a week and stay reasonably mobile while not at work, can it be that dangerous? This particular range of ads even goes as far to suggest that even exercising doesn't lower the health-risks that the evil chairs are contributing by much. I find that very hard to believe.


I think the inactivity physiologist Marc Hamilton sums it up well near the bottom of the "Sit More, And You're More Likely To Be Disabled" NPR article:


  ...exercising for 30 minutes a day doesn't necessarily offset the hours of sitting.

Can increased doses of morphine speed up dying?,
  He hints at a claim held by others to the opposite: that morphine doses can be subtly increased to function as a form of assisted suicide, a.k.a. euthanasia.


Canadian law makes a distinction based on the doctor' intent: they're allowed to give morphine in order to manage pain, even if that shortens life.

The following quotes are from Parliament of Canada - The Special Senate Committee on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide - June 1995


  The Canadian Bar Association referred specifically to the legal status
  of terminal sedation as a medical technique to control pain
  
  ...
  
  The policy of the Ontario coroner is illustrative of the practice in
  this regard. Palliative care that results in death is not considered
  to be criminal, so long as four conditions are satisfied: (1) the care
  must be intended solely to relieve suffering; (2) it must be
  administered in response to suffering or signs of suffering; (3) it
  must commensurate with that suffering; and (4) it cannot be a
  deliberate infliction of death. Documentation is required, and the
  doses must increase progressively.
  
  There is no precedent in this area. There have never been any legal
  convictions for providing such treatment and although there are no
  decided cases on point, a reference was made to the practice of
  providing potentially life-shortening treatment with the purpose of
  alleviating suffering in the Rodriguez case. The real issue in that
  case concerned assisted suicide under section 241 of the Criminal
  Code. Mr. Justice Sopinka, writing for the majority of the Supreme
  Court of Canada, however, drew a legal distinction, based on
  intention, between the administration of drugs that are likely to
  hasten death on the one hand and assistance in suicide on the other.
  Without deciding the issue, by implication he seems to have suggested
  that if the intention is to alleviate suffering, it is legally
  permissible to provide treatment notwithstanding that this may hasten
  death.


The above says, "potentially life-shortening" and "likely to hasten".

Some of the paragraphs after that imply that the expert witnesses disagreed about whether it will in fact shorten life, for example:


  Professor Schafer, testified: If we think about it, what the
  palliative care physician frequently does in giving an adequate dose
  of painkilling medication is hasten the death of the patient, entirely
  justifiably in my judgment, and entirely justifiably in the judgment
  of every one of my philosophical and legal colleagues whose briefs I
  have read.


compared with:


  Dr. Macdonald stated: Another area of confusion is whether or not we
  are killing the patient with these drugs. That was a subject of
  correspondence I had with the committee. People think, for example, if
  we increase the dose of opioids so that a person is stuporous, we may
  kill the patient if we give them a little more. In my experience, that
  is highly unlikely to happen. Patients rapidly become tolerant to the
  respiratory effects of opioids, morphine and like drugs. If we give
  them a large dosage of a drug, we may sedate the patient but it is
  unlikely that the patient would die of our drug. They may die of
  pneumonia or an associated problem which sedation might make more
  likely to come about, but to die directly of a drug effect is unusual.


The last two sentences above implies that it shouldn't cause death directly, but may indirectly.

Are sperm counts in men decreasing significantly?,This meta-analyis examines 50 years of sperm count data and finds that time is a weak predictor of sperm count. 



They fitted a linear (straight) and quadratic (curved) line to the data. Note that in the scatterplots each data point is a study, not an individual.

The result was:


  Our assessment of sperm quality over time leads to the conclusion that neither the linear nor the quadratic model is adequate in describing the data. The linear model suggests a continuous decline (Figure 1) only when more recent reports (Auger et al., 1995; Irvine et al., 1996; Bujan et al., 1996) were excluded in the analysis. The quadratic model, on the other hand, indicates an initial decline followed by a slight increase in sperm count (Figure 2) and more so with the inclusion of the additional European reports (Figure 3). It is therefore possible that additional factors are present in reducing the true effectiveness of these models. An immediate candidate for consideration is demography where political, cultural and industrial influences may have significant implications on sperm quality.


So they are not ruling out that factors such as stress and industrial pollution that have increased over time in some regions (e.g. big cities) are a factor.

They also looked at whether global warming and an increase in a fast food diet might be a factor and found that


  The non-uniform nature of the global sperm count change suggested that local variations in pollution, diet but not global warming were important determinants of reproductive health

Does sleeping with our heads pointing towards north pose any health risks?,No

There are no detrimental effects on the human body of static magnetic fields. This goes for even strong magnetic fields and certainly weak magnetic fields like the Earth's have no influence whatsoever.

Ref: Safety of Strong, Static Magnetic Fields


  Issues associated with the exposure of patients to strong, static magnetic fields during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are reviewed and discussed. The history of human exposure to magnetic fields is reviewed, and the contradictory nature of the literature regarding effects on human health is described. In the absence of ferromagnetic foreign bodies, there is no replicated scientific study showing a health hazard associated with magnetic field exposure and no evidence for hazards associated with cumulative exposure to these fields. The very high degree of patient safety in strong magnetic fields is attributed to the small value of the magnetic susceptibility of human tissues and to the lack of ferromagnetic components in these tissues.

Is routine screening for breast cancer for asymptomatic women worthwhile?,No, screening does not save lives even for the higher risk older groups never mind the lower risk 40-50s.

The evidence I'm going to quote below addresses the broader question of whether screening works for any age group (which was my original question). But, since the evidence clearly shows that the risk of having breast cancer grows with age (older women have higher risk) I hope that simple logic will show that this answer will be even more relevant to the younger group the question now addresses.

I also need to make a statistical clarification before quoting what thorough reviews say, as careless language is one of the reason that the stats are often misunderstood. One key problem is the casual confusion of all-cause mortality with breast-cancer mortality. It is easy to assume that mammography (which is designed to screen for breast cancer) must reduce all cause mortality because it catches some cases of breast cancer. But many studies show a reduction in breast-cancer mortality but no reduction in overall mortality. Guess which number is used by advocates of screening?

The latest Cochrane review (published in 2011) is here. The review was designed to assess:


  To assess the effect of screening for breast cancer with mammography on mortality and morbidity.


Here is one part of the conclusion relevant to the statistical clarification i made above (I've highlighted the important bits and I quote at length to show the different results from different trials):


  Three trials with adequate randomisation did not show a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality at 13 years (relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.02); four trials with suboptimal randomisation showed a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality with an RR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.83). 
  We found that breast cancer mortality was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favour of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death. The trials with adequate randomisation did not find an effect of screening on cancer mortality, including breast cancer, after 10 years (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10) or on all-cause mortality after 13 years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03).


The overall conclusion was (my emphasis again):


  Screening is likely to reduce breast cancer mortality. As the effect was lowest in the adequately randomised trials, a reasonable estimate is a 15% reduction corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 0.05%. Screening led to 30% overdiagnosis and overtreatment, or an absolute risk increase of 0.5%. This means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will have her life prolonged and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress for many months because of false positive findings. It is thus not clear whether screening does more good than harm. Note that more recent large scale studies are now questioning whether the apparent reduction in cancer mortality is real, weakening even further the argument that screening is useful (see latest update for references).


The review recognizes that it is not up to the medical community to recommend blanket screening as only the informed patient can weigh up the cost against the benefit. 

Two key points are worth repeating. Screening isn't costless and the cost of false positives and unnecessary treatment are high. And there is no good evidence that overall mortality is reduced by screening. The intuition expressed by many (especially those lobbyists and politicians who backed away from the original recommendations of the Preventative Services Task Force) is not backed by the hard evidence.

This answers both my original question "does screening reduce mortality" and the more specific question now asked about screening in the low risk 40-50 year olds. 



Some additional information to clarify some misunderstandings raised in comments



What is a Cochrane review?

One thread of comment on the original answer accused me of selectively quoting a result to bolster my preferred point of view. But what I had quoted was not a single result but a Cochrane Review. It appears that not everyone knows what that is and why it is the opposite of a single literature result.

Cochrane Reviews are systematic reviews of the complete literature of studies relevant to a particular claim. They review the known results for quality, bias and the strength of their results and produce a systematic analysis of the weight of evidence designed to summarise as best as possible the known literature. Wikipedia says:


  The Collaboration [The Cochrane Collaboration is the independent organisation that conducts Cochrane reviews] aims to provide compiled scientific evidence to aid well informed health care decisions. It conducts Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials of health care interventions and tries to disseminate the results and conclusions derived from them.


The reviews are described on the organisation's web site as (my emphasis):


  Cochrane Reviews are systematic reviews of primary research in human health care and health policy, and are internationally recognised as the highest standard in evidence-based health care. They investigate the effects of interventions for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. They also assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test for a given condition in a specific patient group and setting. They are published online in The Cochrane Library.


So when I quote results from the Cochrane Library I am not being selective, I am trying to reference the best possible analysis of the whole literature. Moreover, the Cochrane reviews should be less subject to bias than the reviews by government bodies who face political pressure and embarrassment when they change their mind on anything.



Why is this a controversial issue?

It is easy to misunderstand the risk-reward pattern of medical screening. Popular understanding tends to assume (in the absence of epidemiological evidence) that screening is cost-free. It's not exactly surgery, is it? This view has been reinforced by the advice produced by governments to encourage patients to participate in screening programmes. This advice has often been criticised for not being honest about the harms of screening (the controversy in the NHS about patient advice is summarised in the BMJ here). The article argues that even the revised NHS leaflet fails in its duty because:


  No mention is made of the major harm of screening—that is, unnecessary treatment of harmless lesions that would not have been identified without screening. This harm is well known and acknowledged, even among screening enthusiasts. It is in violation of guidelines and laws for informed consent not to mention this common harm, especially when screening is aimed at healthy people.


A previous analysis of advice to patients from other health systems argued:


  The major harm of screening, which is overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment of healthy women, was not mentioned in any of 31 invitations.


The early days of screening also happened to coincide with significant improvement in breast cancer mortality which was ascribed to the benefits of screening. In principle, however, mortality can be improved by better treatments which would have been implemented even in the absence of screening. Recent evidence has tipped the balance away from screening (see this BMJ review comparing different European countries).

So there are several reasons why many people will overstate the net benefits of screening. as better evidence emerges it is likely that that evidence will provoke controversy. 



Update February 2014

Another large long term and properly randomised study (in the BMJ) has concluded that screening doesn't even reduce mortality from breast cancer (at least when good therapies are available). In their words:


  Annual mammography in women aged 40-59 does not reduce mortality from breast cancer beyond that of physical examination or usual care when adjuvant therapy for breast cancer is freely available. Overall, 22% (106/484) of screen detected invasive breast cancers were over-diagnosed, representing one over-diagnosed breast cancer for every 424 women who received mammography screening in the trial.


So screening does no good but comes at the cost of significant over treatment (women suffer surgery and other clinical interventions that do harm but create no benefit).

Do cats and dogs have saliva that has antibacterial or antiseptic properties?,In 1922 Fleming discovered an antiseptic compound capable of killing and dissolving certain bacteria ( * ) which he called "lysozyme” ( * * )

Many animals have this protein: cat, human, dogs, it can even be found in the eggs ( * * * ). All mammals do.

This protein is widely distributed in the animal body, but is found in high concentration in saliva, blood, tears and duodenal (from the small intestine) secretions. 

Epstein and Chain' of Oxford University (dunno the date) have confirmed the antiseptic effect of lysozyme by identifying the lysozyme-susceptible substrate in bacterial cells. 

The antibacterial properties of saliva where studied later on dogs. It showed that the maternal grooming and in licking of wounds after birth helps prevent the infection of the wounds, but that not all types of bacteria are affected (Hart BL, Powell KL)

However the lysozyme can not dissolve the bacterial compounds completely if it is alone. The acidulation of the saliva after swallowing (in the stomach) improves the antiseptic effect of the lysozyme. Another enzyme, the Trypsin which is a protease (it cuts proteins) is capable of dissolving different parts of the bacterial cell. Complete lysis, however, is affected by a combined action of these two enzymes. 

Saliva can prevent the infection but it can not cure anything: British bacteriologists have shown that its bactericide effect depends A LOT on the composition of the cell wall of the bacteria. 



( * ) such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, and Candida albicans. The GRAM+ bacteria are the most affected due to the structure of their cell wall. Follow this link if you do not know what the GRAM test is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_staining

Are Aikido joint locks harmful to children?,As a martial artist of 10 years, and an ex-medical profession in the area of sports/physical therapy I have a fair bit of experience in the area and can safely say that joint locks categorically are more dangerous to children than they are to grown adults.

Despite my experience you're not here for anecdotes, so let's dive into the facts. When a child is born, they are born with their 'bones' made largely of cartilage. As we grow our bones Ossify, becoming harder and less prone to breakages (fracture risks peak in early adolescence). A similar process also occurs with our ligaments, which tighten and strengthen into maturity.

Because there are no direct studies done on joint locks in children (at least, not that I can find), I can concentrate on an example that mimics the forces you might see in a joint lock. The example I am going to concentrate on is radial head subluxation. A pulling motion on the elbow (imagine lifting a child up by the forearms), can cause progressive damage to the annular ligament in the elbow. This damage, as demonstrated by epidemiological studies, is much much more common in young children. 

Now, this really concentrates on the effects of acute injuries. I can't justify with evidence the notion that any gentle joint locks (not causing immediate injury or tear to the ligaments), would cause any long term damage. But the point is, that any acute/traumatic injuries can cause long term problems, and these acute issue are much more common in children. As such, joint locks on children should be practiced only under strict supervision, but as long as you're careful I can find no evidence that the correct, careful and responsible practice of joint locks would cause any long term issues.

Do we need to clean our ears (remove earwax)?,First of all: is it true that earwax (or cerumen) comes out naturally from the ear?

Yes it is. The purpose of ear wax is to trap particles that may enter the ear from the outside, and bring them out of the ear canal. 

From S. Gelfand - Essentials of audiology 


  Cerumen is a waxy substance that is supposed to be in the ear canal, where it serves lubricating and cleansing functions and also helps to protect the ear from bacteria, fungi, and insects. The cerumen is produced by glands in the cartilagenous portion of the ear canal and migrates out over time.  
  
  [cut]  
  
  Impacted cerumen is an accumulation of wax in the ear canal that interferes with the flow of sound in the eardrum. Impacted cerumen occurs naturally in many patients who produce excessive amount of cerumen, which builds up over time. It is also the fate of many Q-tip wielding patients who inadvertently pack cerumen farther back into the canal (and frequently against the eardrum) in an ironic attempt to clean their ears


Should earwax be removed?

The American Academy of Otolaryngology says not to, unless it presents a medical risk.

From their website


  When should the ears be cleaned?
  
  Under ideal circumstances, the ear canals should never have to be cleaned. However, that isn’t always the case. The ears should be cleaned when enough earwax accumulates to cause symptoms or to prevent a needed assessment of the ear by your doctor. This condition is all cerumen impaction, and may cause one or more of the following symptoms:
  
  Earache, fullness in the ear, or a sensation the ear is plugged
  Partial hearing loss, which may be progressive
  Tinnitus, ringing, or noises in the ear
  Itching, odor, or discharge
  Coughing




Various methods exist to remove cerumen. Wikipedia lists:


  A number of softeners are effective; however, if this is not sufficient, the most common method of cerumen removal is syringing with warm water. A curette method is more likely to be used by otolaryngologists when the ear canal is partially occluded and the material is not adhering to the skin of the ear canal. Cotton swabs, on the other hand, push most of the earwax further into the ear canal and remove only a small portion of the top layer of wax that happens to adhere to the fibres of the swab.


There is also quite a bit of literature on the matter.

This paper (bear in mind that it was written in 1990, so it may not be reflecting the current situation), surveys 289 practitioners about "the methods of removing ear wax [...] and the incidence of associated complications". 

Ear wax removal: a survey of current practice - Sharp et al. 1990


  The 289 replies received (92% of the study group) indicated that each doctor saw an average of nine patients (range five to 50 or more) requesting the removal of ear wax per month (table I). The initial medical assessment was made by 179 general practitioners
  (62%). No medical assessment was made by 23 (8%); these patients were referred directly to the practice nurse. The remaining 87 (30%) offered examination by either the doctor or nurse.


The most used method of wax removal was syringing a ceruminolytic agent (something that melts the wax, such as oil or bicarbonate or special formulations), either done directly by the doctor or by a nurse.

The paper reports that


  Complications had been experienced by 105 practitioners (38%) and included perforation, canal lacerations, and failure of wax removal. The removal of occlusive wax improved hearing by a mean of 5 dB over the frequencies analysed.


and concludes that:


  About 44000 ears are syringed each year in the area and complications requiring specialist referral are estimated to occur in 1/1000 ears syringed. The incidence of complications could be reduced by a greater awareness of the potential hazards, increased instruction of personnel, and more careful selection of patients.


A more recent systematic review of clinical trials can be found in

The safety and effectiveness of different methods of earwax removal: a systematic review and economic evaluation. - Clegg et al. 2010

They analyzed 22 randomised controlled trials and 4 controlled clinical trials, using different types of softeners, with or without irrigation.

They report that:


  On measures of wax clearance Cerumol, sodium bicarbonate, olive oil and water are all more effective than no treatment; triethanolamine polypeptide (TP) is better than olive oil; wet irrigation is better than dry irrigation; sodium bicarbonate drops followed by irrigation by nurse is more effective than sodium bicarbonate drops followed by self-irrigation; softening with TP and self-irrigation is more effective than self-irrigation only; and endoscopic de-waxing is better than microscopic de-waxing. AEs (adverse events) appeared to be minor and of limited extent. Results of the exploratory economic model found that softeners followed by self-irrigation were more likely to be cost-effective [24,433 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)] than softeners followed by irrigation at primary care (32,130 pounds per QALY) when compared with no treatment. Comparison of the two active treatments showed that the additional gain associated with softeners followed by irrigation at primary care over softeners followed by self-irrigation was at a cost of 340,000 pounds per QALY. When compared over a lifetime horizon to the 'no treatment' option, the ICERs for softeners followed by self-irrigation and of softeners followed by irrigation at primary care were 24,450 pounds per QALY and 32,136 pounds per QALY, respectively.


They conclude that:


  Although softeners are effective, which specific softeners are most effective remains uncertain. Evidence on the effectiveness of methods of irrigation or mechanical removal was equivocal. Further research is required to improve the evidence base, such as a RCT incorporating an economic evaluation to assess the different ways of providing the service, the effectiveness of the different methods of removal and the acceptability of the different approaches to patients and practitioners.

Are one-hit knockouts possible?,In movies, knocking someone unconscious can look like this:



It can be a PG-13 way to take care of a bad guy, who wakes up sometime later with only a headache.
(However, more realistic depictions can be found, usually in war movies.)

In real life, it looks more like this:



What isn't shown is that in reality a person knocked unconscious is usually knocked out only for a few seconds, minutes at most.  

If a person is knocked out for longer than that, this may indicate severe brain damage, which could lead to loss of function, life-long debilitation, coma, and death.  Essentially, a blow hard enough to knock a person unconscious is classified as a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).  Since most guards,henchmen,etc.in movies are knocked out for extended periods of time, it quite possible that they may suffer severe brain damage. 

Also the force (Scientific American has one pro boxer's punch at 400kg)required to knock someone out might also break the skull or kill the person. Even wikipedia's article on boxing states that there is no clear line drawn between the force needed to knock someone out and the force needed to kill that person. 

So, knocking someone unconscious by hitting them in the head is clearly not as practical or consequence-free as tv and movies might lead one to believe.

The most common causes of being knocked unconscious are related to either falls or vehicle crashes.  However, direct trauma to the head is another cause, the CDC lists assault as accounting for 10% of reported cases.  (Fact: Chuck Norris is responsible for 9.7%)

What is TBI?


  Traumatic brain injury is the most
  common cause of death and disability
  in young people. There is much hope
  for improvement in early care and
  functional outcome by use of
  scientific evidence-based guidelines.
  Traumatic brain injury is graded as
  mild, moderate, or severe on the basis
  of the level of consciousness or
  Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score after
  resuscitation (panel). Mild traumatic
  brain injury (GCS 13–15) is in most
  cases a concussion and there is full
  neurological recovery, although many
  of these patients have short-term
  memory and concentration
  difficulties.1 In moderate traumatic
  brain injury (GCS 9–13) the patient is
  lethargic or stuporous, and in severe
  injury (GCS 3–8) the patient is
  comatose, unable to open his or her
  eyes or follow commands. Patients with
  severe traumatic brain injury
  (comatose) have a significant risk of
  hypotension, hypoxaemia, and brain
  swelling. If these sequelae are not
  prevented or treated properly, they
  can exacerbate brain damage and
  increase the risk of death. source


In reality, TBI consists of more than just the initial impact.

Step 1: Impact

The main thing to keep in mind is:


  Although TBI is a problem of major
  medical and socioeconomic
  significance, its pathogenesis is
  incompletely understood, and it is
  often difficult to reconstruct the
  events leading to the primary and
  secondary lesions of varying severity
  and regional distribution that
  constitute TBI source


This means that while there are some general aspects and theories we can apply broadly to patients with TBI, it is by no means a cut-and-dry phenomenon, and individual cases show great variation.



At the time of the initial impact, the brain is injured in two places, the place of the impact and the side opposite the place of impact. This happens because the brain is surrounded by fluid and can be moved if if enough force is applied.

In movies, it is this intial impact which renders the victim unconscious, however in reality, this is not always the case.

Step 2: Secondary Injuries:

In reality, the person may not be rendered unconscious by the primary injury.  However, they may become unconscious later due to the secondary injuries. Secondary injuries are typically caused by bleeding or swelling within the skull which compresses the brain.


  The principal mechanisms of TBI are
  classified as (a) focal brain damage
  due to contact injury types resulting
  in contusion, laceration, and
  intracranial haemorrhage or (b)
  diffuse brain damage due to
  acceleration/deceleration injury types
  resulting in diffuse axonal injury or
  brain swelling.2404649 Outcome from
  head injury is determined by two
  substantially different
  mechanisms/stages: (a) the primary
  insult (primary damage, mechanical
  damage) occurring at the moment of
  impact. In treatment terms, this type
  of injury is exclusively sensitive to
  preventive but not therapeutic
  measures. (b) The secondary insult
  (secondary damage, delayed
  non-mechanical damage) represents
  consecutive pathological processes
  initiated at the moment of injury with
  delayed clinical presentation.
  Cerebral ischaemia and intracranial
  hypertension refer to secondary
  insults and, in treatment terms, these
  types of injury are sensitive to
  therapeutic interventions. source


Some common occurrences in head injuries:

Concussions

The word "concussion" has many different meanings to patients, families, and physicians. One definition:a condition in which there is a traumatically induced alteration in mental status, with or without an associated loss of consciousness (LOC). 

A broader definition for concussion: A traumatically induced physiologic disruption in brain function that is manifest by LOC, memory loss, alteration of mental state or personality, or focal neurologic deficits. 

While there are many individual variations, concussions usually result in relatively temporary impairment of neurologic function

Again, things are not so clear cut when dealing with concussions, and post-concussion syndromes:


  Post concussive syndrome (PCS), a
  sequela of minor head injury (MHI),
  has been a much-debated topic. Muddled
  by conflicting findings regarding
  symptom duration, an absence of
  objective neurologic findings,
  inconsistencies in presentation,
  poorly understood etiology, and
  significant methodologic problems in
  the literature, postconcussive
  syndrome (PCS) remains controversial.
  Depending on the definition and the
  population examined, 29-90% of
  patients experience postconcussive
  symptoms shortly after the traumatic
  insult.source(medscape link)


(One symptom of concussions is nausea/vomiting which you don't see in movies too often.)

Intracranial Hematomas


  A hematoma is a swelling of blood
  confined to an organ or tissue, caused
  by hemorrhaging from a break in one or
  more blood vessels. As a cerebral
  hematoma grows, it damages or kills
  the surrounding brain tissue by
  compressing it and restricting its
  blood supply, producing the symptoms
  of stroke. The hematoma eventually
  stops growing as the blood clots, the
  pressure cuts off its blood supply, or
  both. source


They are classified from small to massive depending on diameter and volume. Effects vary according to size and location.



White arrows are pointing to the hematoma.

Intracranial Hemmorhages



Black arrows point to subdural bleeding
White arrow points to the midline shift of the brain.
The build-up of blood in the skull is putting extensive pressure on the brain.  Enough bleeding will essentially "crush" the brain, causing the brainstem to herniate.

Diffuse Axonal Injury
Basically this is extensive damage to the white matter.




  Diffuse axonal injury is one of the
  most important types of brain damage
  that can occur as a result of
  non-missile head injury. Increasing
  experience with fatal non-missile head
  injury in man has allowed the
  identification of three grades of
  diffuse axonal injury. In grade 1
  there is histological evidence of
  axonal injury in the white matter of
  the cerebral hemispheres, the corpus
  callosum, the brain stem and, less
  commonly, the cerebellum; in grade 2
  there is also a focal lesion in the
  corpus callosum; and in grade 3 there
  is in addition a focal lesion in the
  dorsolateral quadrant or quadrants of
  the rostral brain stem. source


Diffuse axonal injuries can occur at the time of the initial impact, or develop during the minutes or hours after the injury.

Length of time unconscious correllates to severity of the brain injury


Post-traumatic amnesia(PTA) is defined as the time from the initial injury until the patient can demonstrate conscious memory of what is going on around him/her.


  The duration of PTA was the best
  predictor of outcome selected in this
  model for all endpoints and elements
  of the physical examination provided
  additional predictive value. source (medscape link)


Age is also a factor in predicting outcome...


  Duration of PTA appears to be a useful
  variable in predicting specific
  functional outcome in the TBI
  population receiving inpatient
  rehabilitation services. The use of
  age as a factor in addition to
  duration of PTA enhances the
  prediction of functional outcome.
  source(medscape link)


Concluding (finally)

Most movies simply cherry-pick the most convenient aspects of head injury to advance their plot.  Either the person will only be unconscious for a very short time and wake up relatively fine, or the person will be unconscious for an extended time, but likely suffer severe consequences.

Are tomatoes associated with increased risk of prostate cancer?,
  Are tomatoes associated with increased risk of prostate cancer?


It's quite the opposite. Tomatoes are associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer.

You might want to look at this peer-reviewed study, it was carried out by researchers from the University of Bristol, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Bristol Nutrition Biomedical Research Unit, Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge and the University of Oxford and funded by the NIHR and Cancer Research UK.

The large and huge study showed that there is a clear association between the consumption of more than 10 portions of tomatoes per week and an 18% reduction in risk of prostate cancer. 

Vanessa Er, from the School of Social and Community Medicine at Bristol University, even said it with her own words:


  Our findings suggest that tomatoes may be important in prostate cancer
  prevention

Does cows' milk contain blood?,We can debunk this just by analysing the claim:


"White blood cells", despite their name, are the cells responsible for the immune system, and occur throughout the body (see reference number 2). Also called leukocytes, the presence of these cells is not an indication that blood (or pus) is present. 
The claim actually says "all cows milk contains them". So even if you milked your own pure-bred grain-fed cow in perfectly clean conditions you would still find leukocytes. This is not a contaminant, it's a perfectly normal part of milk. It's no worse than saying "milk contains fat".
The math is hideously wrong here. A million cells weigh about a millionth of a gram, not a thirtieth of an ounce. So even according to the claim, only one part per million of milk is allowed to be leukocytes.


Yes I referenced Wikipedia, because this is very basic stuff, which Wikipedia is allowed for.
,yes,no
Do artificial colours in food cause hyperactivity in children?,When I first read the question I told myself: OK, here's another of those stupid "natural"="good" "artificial"="bad" claims... however, it seems this is not the case.

There are indeed several studies on the matter, although they generally do not look only at food colouring, but also at other additives such as the preservative sodium benzoate or various sweeteners.

A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was published a few years ago on Lancet

Food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children in the community: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. - McCann, Lancet 2007

Jumping straight to the conclusions, they say that: 


  We have found an adverse effect of food additives on the hyperactive behaviour of 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children. Although the use of artificial colouring in food manufacture might seem superfluous, the same cannot be said for sodium benzoate, which has an important preservative function. The implications of these results for the regulation of food additive use could be substantial.


So, what exactly did they do?

They recruited groups of 3 and 8/9 years old children from Southampton, UK. In particular they had 137 3 years old and 130 8/9 years old completing the study (the paper explains the recruitment in more detail). They then tested the effect (vs. placebo) of 2 mixes, called A and B, containing different amount of various food colouring (sunset yellow, carmoisine, tartrazine, ponceau 4R, quinoline yellow, allura red AC, plus sodium benzoate. 8/9-year-old children had 1.25 times bigger doses.

Now, I don't have kids myself, but reading this sentence I would say this is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more than I would give my kid to eat... anyways


  Doses for mixes A and B for 3-year-old children were roughly the same as the amount of food colouring in two 56-g bags of sweets. For 8/9-year-old children, the dose for mix A was equal to about two bags of sweets a day and for mix B about four bags of sweets a day.


The protocol they followed


  After a week on their typical diet (week 0: baseline diet), the artificial colours to be used in the challenges and sodium benzoate were withdrawn from their diet for 6 weeks. Over this period when challenge with active or placebo drinks were given, additive withdrawal continued (week 1: withdrawal period but receiving placebo; weeks 2, 4, and 6: challenge with randomisation to two active periods and one placebo period; weeks 3 and 5: washout continuing on placebo). During this period, 3-year-old children received the challenge and washout-placebo drinks on a weekly basis and consumed mixed fruit juices (placebo or active) at home (300 mL/day for 3-year-old children, 625 mL/day for 8/9-year-old children), provided in identical sealed bottles. At the beginning of the study, children were assigned by the study administrator by a random-number generator to receive one of six possible sequences of placebo, active mix A, or active mix B challenges across weeks 2, 4, and 6.


All the various mixes were tested so that they could not be discriminated by look and/or taste.

Behaviour was then assessed with different methods (essentially questionnaire given to the parents, assessment of behaviour in classrooms and, for the older children, a visual test). I am not an expert on these matters, so I cannot really comment on these tests, but I assume they're quite standard ways to measure hyperactivity (and I'm sure Lancet recruits competent reviewers...)

I'll skip you all the stats, but the conclusion was that 


  Our complete case data has indicated that the effect sizes, in terms of the difference between the GHA under active mix and placebo challenges, were very similar for mix B in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children. For mix A, the effect for 3-year-old children was greater than for 8/9-year-old children. The effects for mix B were not significant for 3-year-old children because there was greater variability in the response to the active challenges than placebo in this age group. Thus, we recorded substantial individual differences in the response of children to the additives. For both age groups, no significant effect of social and demographic factors was seen on the initial level of GHA or in the moderation of the challenge effects.


They continue saying that:


  The specific deleterious compounds in the mix cannot be determined for the present study and need to be examined in subsequent studies. The effect of artificial colours needs to be differentiated from the effects of preservatives in a 2×2 design. Further investigation would also need to establish whether the age-related difference seen in the present study can be replicated—ie, the effects of mix A being greater for 3-year-old children than for 8/9-year-old children. We examined the effects of additives on changes in behaviour during an extended period in a community-based, double-blinded, placebo-controlled food challenge. A weakness in this approach is the lack of control over when the challenges are ingested in relation to the timing of measures of hyperactivity. This study design also needs extensive resources to obtain multisource and multicontext measures of hyperactivity. We have completed a pilot study showing that changes in hyperactivity in response to food additives can be produced within about 1 h. Therefore, future studies could use more feasible acute double-blinded challenges undertaken in more controlled settings.




There is a big amount of literature on the matter.

I will only link to a couple of reviews, you can go through their references if you want more information.

Do artificial food colors promote hyperactivity in children with hyperactive syndromes? A meta-analysis of double-blind placebo-controlled trials.


  Despite indications of publication bias and other limitations, this study is consistent with accumulating evidence that neurobehavioral toxicity may characterize a variety of widely distributed chemicals. Improvement in the identification of responders is required before strong clinical recommendations can be made.


Dietary sensitivities and ADHD symptoms: thirty-five years of research.


  Artificial food colors (AFCs) have not been established as the main cause of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but accumulated evidence suggests that a subgroup shows significant symptom improvement when consuming an AFC-free diet and reacts with ADHD-type symptoms on challenge with AFCs. Of children with suspected sensitivities, 65% to 89% reacted when challenged with at least 100 mg of AFC. Oligoantigenic diet studies suggested that some children in addition to being sensitive to AFCs are also sensitive to common nonsalicylate foods (milk, chocolate, soy, eggs, wheat, corn, legumes) as well as salicylate-containing grapes, tomatoes, and orange. Some studies found "cosensitivity" to be more the rule than the exception. Recently, 2 large studies demonstrated behavioral sensitivity to AFCs and benzoate in children both with and without ADHD. A trial elimination diet is appropriate for children who have not responded satisfactorily to conventional treatment or whose parents wish to pursue a dietary investigation.


So... essentially there is not a crystal clear answer, but there may be effects of specific food colouring, possibly depending on the sensitivity and the age of the children.

Are a third of the proteins we consume dependent on synthetic fertilizer?,I think the premise is a bit backwards here. The most direct and shortest answer is: No, it does not depend on so much artificial fertilizer. "A uses B" is not the same as "A depends on B". The plants are not going to die if they have no synthetic fertilizer applied.

1) Non-synthetic fertilizers could be used. There is nothing to cite here, as that would be proving a negative. Instead, if anyone were to believe non-synthetic fertilizers were necessary, the onus of burden would be on them to prove why.

2) Another option is to use no fertilizers at all. There are options other than fertilizers that can be used. Letting a resource rest and replenish itself is one tactic. Rotation is another. Farmers can plant different crops in a field each year. The different plants have different needs, so by planting crop A this year they consume more of chemical B from the ground, but next year plant C needs chemical D, so we're all good - further, some plants actually put certain nutrients into the ground which could be good for next year's crop. You can also let a field lie fallow. You can also just completely ignore a field for 1 or more years so it has plenty of rest. All of these options can be done using zero fertilizer.

3) You can also just ignore good farming practices and just do whatever you want, just keep planting the same thing in the same place and accept that your plants will eventually perform poorly.

So many non-synthetic fertilizer options.

Many of these options will result in at least slightly reduced crop yield, so you need to utilize more land area to get the same amount of product output. But again, that does not mean that there is a dependency on the synthetic fertilizer, just that the synthetic fertilizer is chosen instead of using more land area.

So you see, there are other resources that can be used instead of synthetic resources, such as: non-synthetic fertilizers, land, different choices in field planning. Even if you do use these other options, however, once you have used all your non-synthetic fertilizer, all the land available, and if you are using proper field planning techniques, then that leaves you with X amount of produce. If you want greater than X, then you need to find some other way to increase production, and if you're already doing everything else then the answer is either use synthetic fertilizer or accept the amount of produce you have.

So no, there is no dependency. It is a choice, a choice which not everyone in the world makes. Synthetic fertilizer is just another tool in the toolbox, and each tool user decides what tools they use. Because it's easiest and provides the maximum produce per unit area, many decide to just order up a tank of fertilizer, whether it is synthetic or not, and drop it on the field.

Does the artificial sweetener aspartame cause cancer?,There's still some open questions from a study newer than those cited in some other answers:  Life-Span Exposure to Low Doses of Aspartame Beginning during Prenatal Life Increases Cancer Effects in Rats

This study found statistically significant increases in lymphomas and leukemias in rats fed several times a normal human intake over the course of the rats' lifetimes.

The study also raises concern with the methodology used in earlier studies. Specifically: 


  The two aforementioned epidemiologic
  studies (Gallus et al. 2006; Lim et
  al. 2006) published after our first
  mega-experiment (Belpoggi et al. 2006;
  Soffritti et al. 2005, 2006) merit
  general comment. Both studies consider
  the eating habits of a large
  population of males and females 50–70
  years of age in the 1990s. Given the
  time frame of these surveys and the
  commercialization of aspartame in the
  1980s, the subjects’ potential use of
  the sweetener could not have exceeded
  10–15 years. It is difficult to
  believe that this limited adult period
  of exposure to APM could confirm or
  exclude a potential carcinogenic risk.
  The design of these studies underlines
  the importance of conducting an
  epidemiologic study in which exposure
  to APM is monitored beginning in fetal
  life, particularly given the use of
  products containing APM by children
  and women of child-bearing age.


The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a group which lobbies for truth in labeling, summarizes the issue here, mentioning industry reaction to this study. They note that "It is likely that the new studies found problems that earlier company-sponsored studies did not because the Italian researchers monitored the rats for three years instead of two. The Italian tests remain controversial, with the industry contending that they were flawed in several ways and with the FDA stating its scientists couldn't evaluate the studies because the researchers refused to provide their original data."

So, eh. I don't think there's cause for a panic, but the question doesn't seem completely resolved. It's worth nothing that CSPI doesn't seem to give a blanket "fail" to all artificial sweeteners, currently listing Sucralose (Splenda) as appearing to be safe. Oh, and Neotame as well. In fact, since neotame is 40x sweeter than aspartame, requiring correspondingly lower dosage, that may be the safest bet so far.

Oh, and the idea that aspartame stays in your body forever is nonsense. It breaks down into aspartic acid, phenylalanine and methanol.

Are eggs more likely to contain salmonella in the yolk than the white?,Your friends who say yolks don't get salmonella infections are dangerously wrong.

It seems that Salmonella infections tend to start on either in the albumen (the egg white) or the layer between the yolk and the albumen, called the Vitelline Membrane:


T.J. Humphrey
Contamination of egg shell and contents with Salmonella enteritidis: a review
International Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 21, Issues 1–2, January 1994, Pages 31–40
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-1605(94)90197-X



  In egg contents the most important sites of contamination are either the outside of the vitelline membrane or the albumen surrounding it. In fresh eggs, only few salmonellas are present and as albumen is an iron-restricted environment, growth will only occur once storage-related changes to vitelline membrane permeability, which allow salmonellas to invade yolk contents, have taken place. When this happens high populations are achieved in both yolk contents and albumen. 


Do you count that layer as the yolk? If not, strictly, there are more infections in the albumen than the yolk. If so, you might get a practical measurement more like this:


Deposition of Phage Type 4 and 13a Salmonella enteritidis Strains in Yolk and Albumen of Eggs Laid by Experimentally Infected Hens



  [...] incidence of yolk contamination (approximately 2.5% overall) was significantly greater than the incidence of albumen contamination (approximately 0.5% overall).


But that doesn't take a more important issue into account. 


  [...] egg yolk and albumen differ substantially in their ability to support bacterial growth. [...]


Thus, it may be that more eggs are infected in the albumen + vitelline membrane than the yolk proper, but there may be more risk to health in the cases where the eggs are left unrefrigerated and the yolk infections take place. In the case of eggs (under)cooked in their shells, it is more likely the yolk will not reach the necessary temperature to kill the Salmonella cells.

Are fresh tomatoes more healthy than tomato paste?,If one wants to obtain health benefits by the consumption of lycopene in tomato, the amount of lycopene μg per Serving of 1 cup for a raw tomato is 3165 μg while one cup of tomato paste contains 75362 μg of lycopene referring to USDA National Nutrient Database of Standard Reference. 

There are several other  nutrients in tomatoes whose bioavailability varies depending on raw, cooked or processed forms including calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, potassium, sodium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, vitamin C, Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, K and E, pantothenic acid, fibre and folate, as well as a small amount of lipids and amino acids. They also contain phytochemicals such as beta carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, curcumin, tocotrienols, phenol, flavonols such as kaempferol, quercetin, rutin, and flavanones.


Per C Gartner et.al. in 1997, in humans the bioavailability of lycopene is greater from tomato paste than from fresh tomatoes. Researchers believe that processing or cooking the tomatoes breaks down cell walls, making the lycopene more accessible to the body when ingested.
Per Melody J Brown et.al. in 2004, research shows that absorption of lycopene is further enhanced when it is consumed with a small amount of fat.



  Lycopene bioavailability showed the most dramatic improvement when added fat was increased from 6 to 28 g. The pronounced fat effect for lycopene is consistent with the hypothesized interaction of fat and the extent of micellar solubilization of vegetable carotenoids.

Does the digestion of some foods burn more calories than it supplies?,There seems to be some evidence to support it: 


Snopes.com claims most of the benefit comes from the energy used trying to digest what is largely cellulose; it suggests that chewing has little impact on energy use.  It also states that while eating celery you are not eating something else (though I would have thought that that depends on how it is prepared and presented);
The Straight Dope takes this second point further, showing that the time taken to eat celery involves more calorie expenditure (from being alive) than the usable calories in the celery.


So it depends on what you regard as negative-calorie food. Cold water, since the body has to heat it?
,no,yes
Does cooking with extra virgin olive oil cause cancer?,In general, oil is not healthy when burnt. Burnt oil has many negative health effects. 

As far as oils go, extra virgin olive oil has the very desirable property of a high smoke point, which means it is less likely to burn when cooked, and makes it an option for frying. That said, more refined oils like olive pomace oil have an even higher smoke point and lighter taste making them ideal for frying. (Ref.)

Keep also in mind that the quality of the oil makes the smoke point vary significantly.

That said, as far as oils go, olive pomace oil, virgin olive oil and extra virgin olive oil are all "healthy" oils given low levels of saturated and polyunsaturated fats.

Regarding cancer, extra virgin olive oil is considered a potential anticarcinogenic, so quite the opposite of the claim.


  Compared to other vegetable oils, the presence of several phenolic antioxidants in olive oil is believed to prevent the occurrence of a variety of pathological processes, such as cancer.


-- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24326154


  There have been numerous evidences supporting the relationship between olive oil and cancer, with most of the attention being directed toward its fat and phenolic content. [...] It was observed that upon combination treatment, anti-proliferation effects and apoptosis induction were augmented. 


-- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24161488

Many of these studies are more generally about the Mediterranean diet, where olive oil of all kinds is commonly used in cooking.

Is it dangerous to eat the contents of a damaged can?,Damage to a can, including dents, can be a sign of Botulism contamination.  Even a tiny amount of botulinum toxin can be lethal. 


  NEVER USE food from containers that show possible "botulism" warnings: leaking, bulging, or badly dented cans; cracked jars or jars with loose or bulging lids; canned food with a foul odor; or any container that spurts liquid when opening. DON'T TASTE SUCH FOOD! Even a minuscule amount of botulinum toxin can be deadly. 


However, dents by themselves are not necessarily dangerous.  While they can make the can more susceptible to rust, which can allow in air, which can then result in bacterial contamination, so long as the can is still sealed a recent dent is not likely to be a problem.

Have chronic conditions such as heart disease, prostate cancer, infertility ever been linked to everyday exposures to chemicals in food?,A well known culprit for heart disease is table salt. (Sodium Chloride)


  Raised blood pressure is a major cause of cardiovascular disease,
  responsible for 62% of stroke and 49% of coronary heart disease.
  Importantly, the risk of CVD increases throughout the range of blood
  pressure, starting at 115/75 mmHg.(Lewington S et al. Age-specific
  relevance of usual blood pressure to vascular mortality: a
  meta-analysis of individual data for one million adults in 61
  prospective studies. Lancet. 2002; 360, 1903-1913) Salt is the major
  factor that increases blood pressure and is therefore responsible for
  many strokes and heart attacks every year. - See more here.


An high-fat diet must also be taken into account. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of what types of fat there are, what it does to help you (obtain fat soluble vitamins such as Vitamin A, provide energy.) and harm you. (As in heart disease, narrowing of arteries because of fatty deposits such as cholesterol.)
This is true not just for those who are obese, though both high fat diet and obesity are risk factors for cause heart disease and vascular problems. Obesity on it's own but with a favorable diet - ie. a balanced one, but eaten in excess quantity - is known to cause heart disease, type ll diabetes, increased risk of certain cancers, heart attack and stroke. See here.

Prostate cancer seems to have flimsy evidence to support the idea that a high fat and low fruit diet may add to susceptibility:


  Men from western countries, such as the UK and USA, have a higher
  rate of prostate cancer than men from eastern countries such as China
  and Japan. It’s thought that this might be because western diets tend
  to be higher in animal fat (including dairy products) and lower in
  fresh fruit and vegetables. Asian men also tend to have a higher
  intake of soy in their diet. Soy and soy products contain chemicals
  called phyto-oestrogens. Researchers believe these might reduce the
  risk of prostate cancer, but more research is needed to confirm this.


If you finish the article here, it emphasizes that more research is needed, ie. a strong causal connection can not yet be made between a particular diet and the onset of Prostate Cancer.

With regards infertility, here it is suggested avoiding fads such as ginseng, kelp, oysters, garlic and champaigne, which have a folk-tail connection to increased fertility, and just follow a balanced diet:


  an eight-year study of more than 18,000 women that uncovered ten
  evidence-based suggestions for improving fertility. This work, from
  the landmark Nurses' Health Study, fills a critical information gap on
  diet and fertility.


I can find no suggestion (or study) that a particular food reduces fertility. However, there is a suggestion here certain tropical foods can cause spontaneous abortion. (Miscarriage) There are similar claims elsewhere, but again, no studies to confirm or deny a causal connection.

Some ancient methods of birth control are listed here, but again, no study to support their effect, though many are known to be generally poisonous, and we can expect they wouldn't do any prospective baby much good, nor the mother.

Is the peel of commercially-grown apples toxic with pesticides?,At least some agencies charged with ensuring the safety of foods say not.

It is possible that these notions arise from studies into the effects on pesticide residues of washing and cooking of fruit. For example a 2006-2009 UK Study.

The report looked at how detectable levels of residues were affected by washing, peeling and cooking fruit. However in the summary of that report there is no suggestion that residual levels in unwashed fruit were actually unusual or harmful.

In western countries at least, National and international organisations set maximum residual levels (MRL) for pesticides and national and regional organisations perform regular tests to check levels on fruit and vegetables. MRLs are set at a level that young, old and pregnant women can eat daily for the whole of their lives without appreciable risk to their health.


  You don't need to wash or peel fruit and vegetables that would not ordinarily be peeled before consumption (for example apples) because of pesticide residues, as no assumption is made that such foods are peeled when deciding whether a pesticide can be approved for use or setting a legal limit (maximum residue level, MRL).
  
  A package of toxicological studies is carried out on all pesticides before they are approved for use in the European Union. These studies follow internationally agreed guidelines. Based on these studies, levels of exposure to the pesticide that pose no appreciable health risk are determined. Both long term and short term exposures to pesticides are considered during the safety assessment.


UK Food Safety Agency (FSA)


  an 18 kg boy would have to eat 534 apples every day of his life to exceed a residue level that is not dangerous to laboratory animals. And an 18 kg girl would have to eat 13,636 kg of carrots every day of her life to exceed such a level.

Is peanut butter good for removing gum?,Seems true. Loads of vidoes on Youtube, though many of the first ones I found only started showing footage after peanut butter was already in the hair, thus you couldn't really see the gum.

HERE is one that seems to illustrate it working, though you only see footage after peanut butter is already obstructing the view. It does look like gum being removed at the end.

It seems that anything oily may work as well. HERE is a shot of a mother using extra virgin olive oil and shows the gum before, the oil on the hair/gum, and the gum coming out. Assuming you trust there was no funny business when the video cut, that's a fairly conclusive video.

HERE is another with what looks like real gum and recommendations for either olive oil or peanut butter.

HERE is one more, where if you buy they didn't do anything funny before hand, they removed gum quite easily with olive oil but also mentioned that peanut butter works as well.

I realize these are sources from YouTube, but with a lack of peer-reviewed journal publications, I figured videos answering the question would be great, though they require trusting that they're not all conspiring just to get more people to pointlessly fill their hair with oily substances...

Does eating certain food types alter your body temperature?,Per Klaas R Westerterp in 2004, "diet induced thermogenesis (DIT) can be defined as the increase in energy expenditure above basal fasting level divided by the energy content of the food ingested and is commonly expressed as a percentage. It is, with basal metabolic rate and activity induced thermogenesis, one of the three components of daily energy expenditure."


  Postprandial thermogenesis was increased 100% on a high-protein/low-fat diet versus a high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet in healthy subjects. The DIT increases body temperature, which may be translated into satiety feelings. In conclusion, the main determinants of diet-induced thermogenesis are the energy content and the protein-and alcohol fraction of the diet. Protein plays a key role in body weight regulation through satiety related to diet-induced thermogenesis.


Per Kelly G.S. in 2007, "Oral temperatures are influenced by drinking, chewing, smoking, and breathing with the mouth open. Cold drinks or food reduce oral temperatures; hot drinks, hot food, chewing, and smoking raise oral temperatures."

"Temperature is increased after eating or drinking anything with calories. Caloric restriction, as for a weight-loss diet, reduces overall body temperature. Drinking alcohol reduces the amount of daily change, slightly lowering daytime temperatures and noticeably raising nighttime temperatures."

Does potassium deficiency cause cramps?,The ratio of intracellular to extracellular potassium is important in determining the cellular membrane potential. Small changes in the extracellular potassium level can have profound effects on the function of the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems.

Low potassium (hypokalemia) refers to a lower than normal level of potassium in your bloodstream. Potassium is a chemical (electrolyte) that is critical to the proper functioning of nerve and muscles cells, particularly heart muscle cells. Hypokalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level of less than 3.5 mEq/L (3.5 mmol/L). Severe hypokalemia is a level of less than 2.5 mEq/L. 

Most cases of hypokalemia occur in the setting of specific disease states, and most common cause of low potassium is excessive potassium loss in urine or from the digestive tract, transcellular shift (movement of potassium from serum into cells), or the direct effect of medications. Only rarely is low potassium due to sweating or not getting enough potassium in your diet. 

Patients are often asymptomatic, particularly those with mild hypokalemia. Symptoms that are present are often from the underlying cause of the hypokalemia rather than the hypokalemia itself. The symptoms of hypokalemia are nonspecific and predominantly are related to muscular or cardiac function. 

Those symptoms include: weakness and fatigue (most common), palpitations, psychological symptoms (eg, psychosis, delirium, hallucinations, depression). Muscle cramps and pain are only present in severe cases, as Troponin's (a regulatory protein complex that is integral to muscle contraction in skeletal and cardiac muscle) becomes impaired. Therefore, hypokalemia can hyperpolarize skeletal muscle cells, impairing their ability to develop the depolarization necessary for muscle contraction. It can also reduce blood flow to skeletal muscles. The reduced blood flow can predispose patients to Rhabdomyolysis (damaged skeletal muscle tissue breaks down its breakdown products are released into the bloodstream) especially when vigorous exercise is combined with impaired blood-flow regulation. The combination of these effects frequently leads to muscle weakness, easy fatigability, cramping, and myalgias. Paralysis, although uncommon, can occur in cases of profound potassium deficiency.

Does eating burnt toast neutralize ingested poison?,
  Activated carbon is used to treat poisonings and overdoses following oral ingestion. Tablets or capsules of activated carbon are used in many countries as an over-the-counter drug to treat diarrhea, indigestion, and flatulence.
  However, it is ineffective for a number of poisonings including strong acids or alkali, cyanide, iron, lithium, arsenic, methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol.


Source, emphasis mine.


  Activated carbon is carbon produced from carbonaceous source materials such as nutshells, coconut husk, peat, wood, coir, lignite, coal, and petroleum pitch. It can be produced by one of the following processes:
  Physical activation: The source material is developed into activated carbons using hot gases. Air is then introduced to burn out the gasses, creating a graded, screened and de-dusted form of activated carbon. This is generally done by using one or a combination of the following processes:
  Carbonization: Material with carbon content is pyrolyzed at temperatures in the range 600–900 °C, usually in inert atmosphere with gases like argon or nitrogen


Source, emphasis mine.

Given the production process it appears that toast would not be a good source of activated carbon (otherwise they would just burn toast!). Even if it is, activated carbon is not effective for a number of poisons so it's pretty clear that burned toast would not be a good treatment for poisoning.  



That being said, here are the answers from chemistry.stackexchange.com which expresses doubt on whether the toast would be a good source of activated charcoal.
There is also a mention that actual activated charcoal does seem to retain its adsorption properties even when submerged in some fluids. The person does not provide any references or confirmations though.

Are zinc supplements beneficial?,Zinc, like iron, is an element that you need. If you are a 'healthy' person, eating 'normal' (these are kind-of subjective, that's why the marks) you will get enough of these in your daily food. See for advice for instance this site. You could argue that if you take some sort of special diet, like being a vegan, you might need to consider taking supplements.

Like iron, it is possible you have too little of it, but I would only start taking supplements anyway if advised by a doctor and as a response to some sort of problem: not as a general course of action.

I do not know these ads, but I suspect they might even try to sell you them to avoid problems. If you have no problems because of too little zinc, more zinc will not help you. It does not 'stack', it will not better you in any way to take more then you need. 

As @egle 's link points out, there might be some value to the thought that zinc acetate can be used to decrease the duration and severity of cold symptoms, especially cough. 1. This is not how supplements are marketed as far as I know. This would be considered 'treatment' of a problem (cold).

Does taking whey protein make you gain muscle?,Just whey protein consumption by itself won't make you gain muscle. As far as whey is concerned it is a fast moving protein so if the body doesn't have any place to store the incoming whey it is simply burned off for energy. Here's the resource for this info.

Muscles growth is based on two factors:


Necessity for the muscle tissue to grow.
Adequate nutrition that can help it to grow.


So if you engage in adequate exercise that force your muscles to increase so as to handle the stress of exercise then taking some amount of whey (or better, some slow moving protein) post exercise would help in muscle recovery and growth.

W.r.t. the second part of your question, the same site also cites a Boirie study from 1997 which compares the effects of Whey VS Casein on muscle growth in athletes. You might find your answer there.

Does eating birds' nests stimulate the regeneration of cells?,These claims are all pseudo-scientific. There is no good evidence of the birds' nests having medical value. (It is not even clear that the claim of "stimulating the regeneration of cells" is necessarily a beneficial thing.)

A paper reviewing the evidence was written in 2012, *Sketch of the edible bird's nest and its important bioactivities. Despite the authors being very optimistic about the (undemonstrated) potential benefits of the food, they were forced to conclude:


  its bioactivities and medicinal value are still open to
  question as there are not much scientific research on the medicinal
  properties. Not many components contributing to the biological functions
  of edible bird's nest have been isolated and purified from the
  nest so far. This reason along with the nests' high price makes the
  procedure of investigating the bioactivity of the edible bird's nest
  more difficult. As there is a mess in the use of classification methods
  of edible bird's nests at present, it's important for future researchers
  to make clear what species their nests belong to. More proteome
  and genome studies should be carried out to thoroughly investigate
  edible bird's nest. More scientific work should be done to elucidate
  the biological and medicinal functions of the nest.


In short, there is no reason to believe birds' nests treat any illnesses and the proponents aren't even clear which species of birds should be used for their nests. Chinese Traditional Medicine is a pseudo-science.

Is carbonated water unhealthy?,First, regarding general health effects of carbonation, in their 1992 paper Lambert et al compare re-hydration after exercise for carbonated and non carbonated beverages. The paper measures blood plasma levels prior to dehydration and after the administration of test solutions concluding;


  A major finding of this investigation
  was that fluid replacement was similar
  in the carbonated and non-carbonated
  treatments. ... the similar plasma
  volume and total plasma protein values
  at all time points suggest that
  beverage carbonation did not
  measurably alter the availability of
  ingested fluid.


Also, Cuomo et al investigate the effects of carbonation on digestion, concluding 


  In patients complaining of functional dyspepsia and constipation, carbonated water increases satiety and improves dyspepsia, constipation and gallbladder emptying.


Which may explain why many people use sugarless carbonated beverages (such as sprite) to calm upset stomachs.

Also, a particularly interesting paper by Simons et al investigates the oral sensation associated with carbonated beverages, arguing


  carbonated water excites lingual
  nociceptors via a carbonic
  anhydrase-dependent process, in turn
  exciting neurons in Vc that are
  presumably involved in signaling oral
  irritant sensations.


Regarding kidney function, beverages with high fructose content may pose a risk whether carbonated or not. Studying rats, Gersch et al find an association between fructose and kidney problems. 

Next, El-Badrawy et al touch on a distinction between 'cola' and 'un-cola' beverages, finding histopathological effects (I needed a quick wikipedia to understand this refers broadly to tissue damage) from colored soft drinks only. 


  The kidney of rats consuming dark
  color soft drink showed congestion of
  interlobular homogenous proteinaceaus
  casts in some renal tubules (Pict.7).
  While the kidney of rats consuming
  orange color showed the previous
  changes with congestion of the
  glomerular tufts (Pict. 8). Kidney of
  rats consuming colorless soft drink
  revealed no histopathological changes
  (Pict. 9), meanwhile, kidney of rats
  consuming mixed soft drink showed
  vacuolation of endothelial lining the
  glomerular tuft together with
  necrobiotic changes of epithelial
  lining of some renal tubules (Pict
  .10).


Like the original poster, I had trouble finding a credible source clearly attributing health impacts to one or more ingredients in soda individually.  Many papers unequivocally argue soft drinks are harmful to health generally, but parsing out the effect of carbonation seems more difficult. 

Even in a randomized setting, isolating the effect of one substance consumed in tandem with many others poses a challenge. Also, though similar in many ways, humans and rats differ. With these caveats in mind, the research outlined above seems to suggest the primary health risk associated with cola may be attributed to sugar content. That said, none of the literature I reviewed affirmed the negative, i.e. ``carbonated water does not impair kidney function''.

Are small and frequent meals better for health?,It seems that one of the most obvious disadvantages with irregular meals is the increase of insulin resistance which can lead to type 2 diabetes. 

http://www.ajcn.org/content/81/1/3.full#R19


  The effect of the timing of food intake on metabolism has been the subject of active investigation for >40 y. Indeed, whether it is "better" to eat many small meals a day is one of the questions most frequently posed by the lay public. Comparing the potential benefits of nibbling and of gorging has been the focus of much animal and human research, but no clear consensus has emerged (1-7). Simply put, the question of whether there is a health benefit from the consumption of multiple small meals will ultimately depend on how much energy is consumed, as opposed to how often or how regularly one eats. This possibility raises 2 questions. First, is it easier to overeat under a regimen of frequent, irregular meals? Second, how does the pattern of meal consumption affect metabolic health? 


...


  As shown by Farshchi et al, the regular eating frequency was associated with lower reported ad libitum energy intakes and lower fasting total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations. In addition, they concluded that the irregular eating frequency may have reduced insulin sensitivity because that pattern was associated with a lower thermic effect of food (TEF), a higher peak insulin concentration, and a larger 3-h area under the curve of postprandial insulin concentrations. One practical limitation of the work by Farshchi et al is that each dietary phase was only 14 d long and thus did not result in large effects (eg, an ≈9% greater peak postprandial insulin concentration and an 8% lower TEF). 


...


  Two last issues raised by Farshchi et al (8) are whether the effects on metabolism of eating regularity are independent of or mediated by energy intake, and, if there are independent effects, what mechanisms contribute to these effects. With respect to insulin resistance, endocrinologists have long known that, when diabetics are hospitalized for observation, they have significant improvements in blood glucose and insulin concentrations—an effect partially caused by the consumption of regular balanced meals (19). Yet the exact mechanism supporting improved insulin response is unknown.


http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15085170


  RESULTS:
  There were no significant differences in body weight and 3-day mean energy intake between the regular and irregular meal pattern. In the irregular period, the mean energy intake on the day when 9 meals were eaten was significantly greater than when 6 or 3 meals were consumed (P=0.0001). There was no significant difference between the 3 days of the regular meal pattern. Subjective appetite measurement showed no significant differences before and after the test meal in all visits. Fasting RMR showed no significant differences over the experiment. The overall thermic effect of food (TEF) over the 3 h after the test meal was significantly lower after the irregular meal pattern (P=0.003).
  
  CONCLUSION:
  Irregular meal frequency led to a lower postprandial energy expenditure compared with the regular meal frequency, while the mean energy intake was not significantly different between the two. The reduced TEF with the irregular meal frequency may lead to weight gain in the long term.

Is it possible to influence the sex of a baby by controlling the mothers' diet?,In short: no.   

There is, as you point out yourself, some research shows that (pre-conception) diet can be an influence, but nothing more than that. The mother definitely can not decide the gender. 

I had a hard time finding research that replicated this result, only links of more news-like sites that refer to the paper you already linked.

From a BBC news article (emphasis mine):


  Dr Allan Pacey, an expert in fertility
  at the University of Sheffield, said
  there was good evidence that nature
  had subtle ways of changing the sex
  ratio of a population in response to a
  variety of circumstances. However, he
  said: "I would urge women to not to
  start starving themselves in order to
  try influence the sex of their baby.
  "It has been observed in some animal
  studies that even small changes in
  female diet can affect the life long
  health of the offspring, so it is
  important that the mother has
  appropriate nutrition at the time of
  conception and throughout her
  pregnancy."


So from this single article alone I would conclude that although there is an influence of certain factors on the sex of the child (food being one of them), there is no way (and certainly no safe way) to decide the sex of your child.

Did almost all tilapia sold in US undergo sex change?,A quick Web Search turned up an excerpt from Testosterone: Action, Deficiency, Substitution (page 410-411).  It did acknowledge the potential negative side-effects of methyltestosterone, and that the appropriate authorities in Germany had ruled that it be removed from the market (where it was being used for medical purposes).  It also noted that the half-life in the blood was approximately 150 minutes, with maximal blood levels 90-120 minutes after ingestion.  As such, it's pretty unlikely that clinically pertinent quantities are making their way to your dinner plate.

A bit more google searching suggests that there have been numerous books written on the subject of tilapia aquaculture, and that a fair number of those books discuss the use of methyltestosterone for the purpose.  It's at least plausible, then, that most of the fish making its way to the supermarket has been so treated, and near-certain that a reasonable percentage has.  There doesn't seem to be a reason to doubt that particular claim.

...and, en fin, it looks like this particular issue was a matter of some specific concern, and subject to investigation... in the 1980s.  Culture of Nonsalmonid Freshwater Fishes, Second Edition, page 98.  Final conclusion was that the hormone's persistence once it left the gut was minimal, and that it posed no public health concern.

Is storing food in opened tin cans dangerous?,First you have to figure out what cans are made of. There's many metals used, and then there's alloys of those metals.
Tin (or rather tin plated steel alloy), and aluminium seem the most common. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_can

Wikipedia has this to say about tin poisoning from cans: 


  Tin has no known natural biological role in living organisms. It is not easily absorbed by animals and humans. The low toxicity is relevant to the widespread use of tin in dinnerware and canned food.[1] Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been reported after ingesting canned food containing 200 mg/kg of tin.[2] This observation led, for example, the Food Standards Agency in the UK to propose upper limits of 200 mg/kg.[3] A study showed that 99.5% of the controlled food cans contain tin in an amount below that level.[4]


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_poisoning

For aluminium, toxicity is even less apparently:


  Despite its natural abundance, aluminium has no known function in biology. It is remarkably nontoxic, aluminium sulfate having an LD50 of 6207 mg/kg (oral, mouse), which corresponds to 500 grams for a 80 kg person.[6] The extremely low acute toxicity notwithstanding, the health effects of aluminium are of interest in view of the widespread occurrence of the element in the environment and in commerce.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_poisoning#Health_concerns

Thus, it's highly unlikely you'll suffer any ill effects from food exposed to the metal of your can.

In the past lead solder was used to seal the cans, which did lead to poisoning as lead of course is rather toxic (which was not well understood at the time):


  Early cans were sealed with lead soldering, which led to lead poisoning. Famously, in the 1845 Arctic expedition of Sir John Franklin, crew members suffered from severe lead poisoning thought to be caused by eating canned food. More recent research suggests the lead poisoning was more likely to have been caused by the internal pipe system on the ships.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_can
This could well be the origin of this myth, however the poisoning could happen with sealed as well as opened cans.
Now, with the scare about BPA poisoning, the internal coating/liner of modern cans is blamed by some for all kinds of scary diseases as well, but as mentioned in other questions there is no real scientific evidence to back up the claims that BPA is toxic in the concentrations found in those linings except maybe for infants.
For example a recent US government study indicates that:



  
  For infants and children the Expert Panel has the following levels of concern for biological processes that might be altered by Bisphenol A, as follows:
  • some concern for neural and behavioral effects
  • minimal concern for the effect of accelerated puberty
  For adults, the Expert Panel has negligible concern for adverse reproductive effects following exposures in the general population to Bisphenol A. For highly exposed subgroups, such as occupationally exposed populations, the level of concern is elevated to minimal.[8]:382-383[61]
  


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol-A


Ergo, I can only conclude that there is no reason to assume that having open cans in the fridge as storage containers would cause any adverse effects on your health, as long as the same precautions are taken as with any other food container. Any effects that might ensue would be no different from having the sealed can in there.

Does honey ever go bad?,It is common knowledge that sugar will help microorganism growth (that's why, for instance, when you rehydrate freeze-dried yeast you add a pinch of sugar to help it restart its activity).

Too much sugar (or any other solute, really), however, is not good for microbial growth.

One parameter that is usually taken into account is the water activity.

Quoting Wikipedia:


  [Water activity] is defined as the vapor pressure of a liquid divided by that of pure water at the same temperature; therefore, pure distilled water has a water activity of exactly one.
  As the temperature increases, aw typically increases, except in some products with crystalline salt or sugar.
  Higher aw substances tend to support more microorganisms. Bacteria usually require at least 0.91, and fungi at least 0.7.


Honey generally has a water activity between 0.5 and 0.6. (See this PDF), too low to support microbial growth. 

Honey is in fact a well known antimicrobial, although the high sugar content is not the only factor contributing to this (low pH and presence of several antibacterial compounds play a role there).

To answer the question: does honey ever go bad?

From the US National Honey Board website


  Honey stored in sealed containers can remain stable for decades and even centuries! However, honey is susceptible to physical and chemical changes during storage; it tends to darken and lose its aroma and flavor or crystallize. These are temperature-dependent processes, making the shelf life of honey difficult to define. For practical purposes, a shelf life of two years is often stated. Properly processed, packaged and stored honey retains its quality for a long time. If in doubt, throw it out, and purchase a new jar of honey!


So, essentially, if you stored it properly you will not have any issue.

Is the 'Subway diet' healthy?,Your question is kind of vague - what is "healthy"?

Subway diet is unquestionably healthier than Jared Fogle's previous "high-fat junk food" diet, especially coupled with increased physical exercise.

However, it is not considered to be dietitionally/nutritionally perfect by any stretch of imagination. 

Not only there is no research supporting the diet as perfect, here's a quote from Subway's corporate dietitian accompanying the news release about the promotion:


  Both Jared Fogle and a Subway Corporate dietitian acknowledged that some elements were missing from the weight-loss plan designed by the Indiana college student. “It's great that it worked for him, but I would rather he had eaten a balanced breakfast and more fruits and vegetables,” dietitian Lanette Roulier said in a December 2000 news release. 
  
  She pointed out that people's dietary needs varied, and advised the public to consult with a physician and/or dietitian before starting a weight-loss program.
  
  A restrictive diet of only two sandwiches a day is not nutritionally sound. Jared Fogle eliminated fruit and dairy products from his diet. He missed out on the fiber in fruit and nutrients like vitamins A and C. The diet also lacked the calcium found in dairy products.
  
  However, the sandwiches provided fiber and vitamins. Poultry like turkey was among the lean proteins recommended in the USDA guidelines. The federal guide also advised people to limit fat and to participate in regular physical activity. Fogle did both.

Are green potatoes unhealthy to eat?,Wikipedia's Solanine in potatoes explains why some potatoes become green, and what the poison is:


  When potato tubers are exposed to light, they turn green and increase glycoalkaloid production. This is a natural defense to help prevent the uncovered tuber from being eaten. The green colour is from chlorophyll, and is itself harmless. However, it is an indication that increased level of solanine and chaconine may be present.


It's not that the potatoes are "unripe"; for example, new potatoes are edible:


  New potatoes have thin, wispy skins and a crisp, waxy texture. They are young potatoes and unlike their fully grown counterparts, they keep their shape once cooked and cut. They are also sweeter because their sugar has not yet converted into starch, and are therefore particularly suited to salads.

Are there any FDA approved ingredients that are known to be directly harmful when taken at an approved dosage?,The answer to your question changes with how strictly you ask.

No, there are no FDA approved food or color additives known to be harmful.  But yes, it is possible that an FDA approved additive can cause harm. 

To start the use of a additive, a sponsor must submit a petition to show that the proposed use of the additive is safe. (This even is true for animal food)  The FDA reviews the petition to make the call on if the additive is as safe as the sponsor says it is.  If the petition passes, the additive gets to be used.

However:


  Because of inherent limitations of science, FDA can never be absolutely certain of the absence of any risk from the use of any substance. Therefore, FDA must determine - based on the best science available - if there is a reasonable certainty of no harm to consumers when an additive is used as proposed.


So the FDA looks into their research and determines if the additive is safe given the current data. Yet just because the FDA has reached this conclusion does not necessarily imply that the additive is safe. When further studies come out, the FDA analyzes the data and once again makes the best call they can on if the additive is safe.

Take, for example, Aspartame; common low-calorie artificial sweetener.  Studies by the European Ramazzini Foundation (ERF) have concluded that the sweetener is carcinogenic.  But whenever such conclusions are made, the FDA analyzes the new data and reevaluates the safety of the additive.  The FDA issued this statement stating that they have analyzed what data from the study they could, and determined that the ERF's study does not support the conclusion that aspartame is carcinogenic.  (Incidentally, the European Food Safety Authority agrees with the FDA on this)

In summary, when the FDA approves an additive, they can only do so by making their best guess.  If someone says they've made the wrong call, they do their best to investigate the new data.  This is, of course, in general.  Any further analysis would be best done on a single additive that you're skeptical the FDA has made the right call about.

Does nutrition explain why puberty starts earlier than it used to?,TL;DR: This article has poorly constructed arguments. However, it does serve to provide references to support some association (not causation) between diet and early puberty.

First, let me summarise the key arguments in the linked article, just with regards to diet and precocious puberty, which is what the OP is asking about. (That is, I am ignoring claims about cancer, breastfeeding, mental health, etc.):


One of two mentioned factors in precocious puberty is  consumption of cow's milk (no reference provided).
Cow's milk has a high fat content, and other bad things.
These are all linked to early puberty.
Hispanic child are less likely to consume cow's milk. (no reference provided). This argument peters out there. I see no actual claim that Hispanic children have later puberty as a result.


So, we can ignore statement 4. There is no reference for Statement 1 (or 4). I'm not going to argue Statement 2. The critical statement is statement number 3, and three references are provided. (Ref numbers #13, #14, and #15 in the article.) Let's look at those to see if they support the claim.



13: Stoll BA. Western diet, early puberty and breast cancer risk. Breast Cancer Res Treat (England) Jun 1998;49(3):187-93.

This paper is primarily about the increased breast cancer risk associated with early puberty. However, it does briefly summarise the purported causes of early puberty.


  Improving nutrition is generally assumed to be responsible for the secular trend to ever-earlier onset of menarche in Western industrialised countries.


[...]


  Nutritional factors are likely to be responsible and current option is that menarche is provoked by a critical accumulation of adipose tissue rather than through the effects of specific macronutrients [17]. Studies in the USA and Canada have found that earlier onset of menarche is associated with a greater height and weight for age and that after allowing for these variables, there was no association with energy-adjusted intake of fat, protein or carbohydrate in the diet [23, 24]. Nevertheless one prospective study in Germany concluded that a higher energy-adjusted fat intake was associated with accelerated menarche and might be responsible for earlier body fatness [25].

First, it looks at breast cancer, not early puberty. It is off-topic for our discussion, but on-topic for the general article.

Second, it doesn't conclude anything useful for the article


  In conclusion, despite several intriguing hypotheses linking dairy product consumption and breast cancer, the available epidemiologic evidence does not support a strong association between the consumption of milk or other dairy products and breast cancer risk.


Third, it is published in Med Hypotheses, which is a great place to get ideas for future experiments, but not a great place to link to to show that the evidence supports your argument. [More info]



15: Kato I, et al. Factors related to late menopause and early menarche as risk factors for breast cancer. Jpn J Cancer Res (Japan) Feb 1998;79(2):165-72.

This paper was focussed on breast cancer, but relied on surveys of 17,000 Japanese women older than 40 to gauge some of the factors involved in both puberty and menopause.

Note the weakness is asking someone about what happened thirty years earlier, and a dubious assumption that eating habits varied in strength but not in character over the subjects lives. I've not reported the borderline associations (e.g. p>0.05).

Positively correlated factors for early menarche included:


Residence in a metropolitan area
Height, weight and Body-Mass Index (BMI)
Daily intakes of bread, meat, fish, shellfish, egg, green-yellow vegetables, other vegetables, fruits, milk and black tea. 


Inversely correlated were:


Large rice intake, daily miso soup, pickles.
Smoking (as an adult?!)




Conclusion


Adipose fat levels are believed to be a trigger for menarche, although none of the cited articles show that directly, and there is some mixed evidence.
A survey (of moderately weak power) suggests correlations (not causation) between a number of dietary elements and early menarche.
The linked article makes some dubious claims.

Can you "reset" your taste buds?,According to the 2013 book "Salt, Sugar, Fat" by Michael Moss, while humans are born with tastes for fat and sugar (they provoke pleasurable responses in newborns), the taste for salt is acquired (newborns do not enjoy it, but virtually all other humans in the First World do). If a person abstains from consuming salt for a time, they will regain their original sensitivity to it.

As a 2004 University of Washington Study shows, the relationship between humans and salt is much less similar to that with sugar, and much more like the relationship with addictive substances.

Do frozen foods remain safe indefinitely?,Evidence:

Freezing at 0 °F is known to keep food safe by causing microbes to be dormant and prevention of microorganism growth. However, home freezing cannot be trusted  to destroy parasites such as trichina and there are reports of food  contamination from frozen products such as ice cream which had previous pathogen contamination.


  Food stored constantly at 0 °F or below will always be safe. Only the
  quality suffers with lengthy freezer storage. Freezing keeps food safe by
  slowing the movement of molecules, causing microbes to enter a dormant
  stage. Freezing preserves food for extended periods because it prevents
  the growth of microorganisms that cause both food spoilage and
  foodborne illness.


Meaning:


Foods if stored frozen constantly at 0 °F will stay safe over longer duration of time (i.e. until the defined time it stays frozen) but quality of the food may reduce over time due to the slow deterioration of the food components.
The storage time mentioned by the US Department of Agriculture is not viewed by the food industry as "indefinite" since the quality of food will also be considered when determining the storage duration.



  Although freezing can keep food safe for a very long period, the food industry will not label the storage time of frozen food as indefinite. The quality of food also needs to be considered when determining the storage duration. The storage duration for frozen food (usually in terms of months or years) is usually set out as a quality indicator. The duration may be reduced if the freezer temperature cannot reach -18°C or fluctuates to above -18°C.



Thawing is a important factor in ensuring safety of frozen foods. Ice cream is an example of a frozen product which is documented to be contaminated by   different bacterial pathogens.  



  Although the growth of microorganisms is inhibited when frozen, they may not be killed and may become active again when food is thawed. Therefore, food should not be thawed at room temperature because the process will take a long time and microorganisms, including pathogens, can multiply before the food is entirely defrosted. This may render frozen cooked food or frozen ready-to-eat food unsafe and increase the risk of cross-contamination by frozen raw food.

Are diet sodas as healthy as drinking water?,In diet soda you typically have carbonated water, caramel colour, aspartame, phosphoric acid, potassium benzoate, flavouring, citric acid, and caffeine. These are generally non-nutritive, but as with most food products, their health effects are variously under dispute or active research. According to reason, pure water is quite simply lower risk than diet soda, but there's been significant research into the health effects of the latter, with negative effects occurring largely via the psychological and biological trickery of artificial sweeteners.

Further reading:


A brief summary of studies of health effects of aspartame.


  Long-term clinical studies with high doses of aspartame (75 mg/kg/day for 24 weeks, or about 25 times current consumption levels at the 90th percentile) resulted in no changes in clinical or biochemical parameters or adverse experiences compared with a placebo.

Are people dying of starvation because we cannot produce enough food?,I think the answer depends on what you mean by your question, which you stated as: 
Is it "a known risk that people are dying of starvation because we cannot produce enough food"?

As is often the case, we'll need to go into what some of those terms mean. To start with, the risk part you quote is certainly an unlucky choice; if people are dying of starvation, it's not a risk, but a tragedy. Let's start by changing the question to Are people dying of starvation because we cannot produce enough food?

Now, this can have two meanings:


Is enough food being produced worldwide for everyone to have enough to stay alive?
The answer to this one seems to be yes. Although I could not find the original FAO statement, most reputable sources (e.g. the WPF, Oxfam and others) agree that there would be enough to go around (although, once again, I have not found a publication with a clear source indication for this statement).
Would producing more food mean less starvation?
The answer to this one is also yes. The FAO, among many others, has clear recommendations which include a significant growth of agricultural production to ward off famines and starvation now and in the future.


In fact, you can more easily see the (false) dichotomy when you imagine two extreme scenarios. In the first, the world produces exactly as much food as is needed for everyone to have just enough to eat. You could say that any occurring starvation would be only a result of mismanagement; however, it is obvious that an absolutely perfect distribution is impossible - if one egg is dropped somewhere in the world, someone goes hungry. On the other hand, if every town and village produces a hundred times as much food as it needs, there is hardly any chance for even the grossest mismanagement or inequality to produce hunger.

To sum up: the worldwide food situation is influenced by many factors, and both production and distribution are among them (in fact, the FAO report cited above has six groups of security indicators: availability, physical access, economic access, utilization, vulnerability, and shocks). It is an almost undisputed consensus view that we could significantly reduce or even eliminate malnutrition by, among other measures, redistributing the existing supplies. However, it is equally clear that we could reach the same goals by increasing food production. Which of these is the better way is a matter of dispute, with most organizations (such as the UNICEF, Oxfam or FAO) suggesting a combined approach.

Does drinking water prevent dehydration?,My interpretation on this story is that it is simply a confusion of meaning.

If you do not drink any water for a long period, you will get dehydrated.[Ref] Drinking water will help remedy that. [Ref]

However, there are many causes of dehydration, including especially diarrhea, but also other causes such as vomiting, diabetes and burns. [Ref.]

It is false to state that drinking water will prevent ongoing dehydration due to these causes. In fact, it may be appropriate to take other "clear fluids" orally to address the dehydration, e.g. containing electrolytes or even IV drips may be required. [Ref]

My interpretation is that this claim - that water can prevent dehydration - is what the EU declined to approve. Dehydration may occur even when normal levels of water have been consumed.

Is poisoning possible from preservative on orange zest?,Whether or not you can 'wash' off a pesticide/fungicide/preservative is a function of its water solubility.  

In the cases of something which is water soluble, yes, a simple wash will suffice.

Carbofuran is water soluble, and its half-life in mature fruit was estimated at 4 days.

Methidathion is also water soluble:


  Oranges sprayed with Supracide at a
  rate of nearly 2 pounds per acre had
  residues of the compound of about 0.1
  ug/ml [81]. Within 2 days over 60% of
  the compound was removed from the
  outside of the fruit, and within 1
  week, less than 1% of the compound
  remained


For other produce which might be treated with an insoluble chemical compound, you can try using a vinegar wash.  This study on potatoes indicates that washing removes most compounds, as does peeling and food cooking/preparation.

Carbofuran is no longer permitted to be used on fruits in the US, nor be present on fruits imported to the US. It is also not permitted in the EU.

Of course, there is a very simple manner in which you can guarantee no pesticide/fungicide/preservative contamination of your food: buy organic.

Whenever I make cakes or pies which require lemon, lime or orange zest, I buy organic.  Then I don't have to worry.

So, given the short half-lives of these compounds on the fruits, it would be difficult (albeit not entirely impossible if someone ate 10 crates of orange zest) to be poisoned by the residue left on the zest. The same follows for any wax compound: it's a matter of the amount sprayed (which is regulated differently by country) and the amount of time it's left on the fruit.  Some waxes (beeswax) are natural products.

Edited to add:

The following waxes are commonly used in citrus handling:


  The coatings used in this work were as
  follows: Britex 505 (Brogde Co.,
  Pomona, CA); PacRite-StorRite 101,
  which contained polyethylene and
  shellac, and  PacRite-SunShine, which
  contained shellac (American Machinery
  Corp.,Orlando, FL); Primafresh 30,
  which contained carnauba wax and
  shellac (Johnson Wax Co., Racine,
  Canada); Decco Lustr 202, which
  contained natural and synthetic waxes
  and fatty acids (ELF Atochem North
  America Inc., Munrovia, CA); and
  Natural Zivdar, which contained a
  carnauba wax emulsion,and  Industrial
  Zivdar, which contained a polyethylene
  emulsion (Saif-Pac Ltd., Kfar-Saba,
  Israel)


Any coating with carnauba wax will not rinse off in water, nor will it wash off with vinegar. It is soluble in ether, but that's not a big help.

Any coating with shellac will not rinse off in water. You will need to use an baking soda (alkaline compound) to remove it.

The polyethylene emulsion will depend on the particular compound used.

Do raisins need to be refrigerated?,According to the National Raisin Company site, it's just to extend the shelf life or freshness of the product and prevent them from becoming dried out.


  What is the best way to store raisins?

Does frequent tuna consumption pose a health risk?,That's odd that they'd be calling out canned tuna. According to the EPA, canned tuna is safer than tuna steaks and is considered a "low mercury" fish. From the same article, they recommend up to 12 ounces of "low mercury" fish for pregnant women and children. For all others, they commend, at most, an RfD of 0.1 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day. Consumer Reports did a study of mercury levels in tuna and found that the values varied greatly. They believe that 5 ounces (approximately 1 can) should be the limit for pregnant women due to at least 6% of the cans of tuna having enough mercury to hit the same upper limit as the EPA's 12 ounces.

Does unflavoured carbonated water cause damage to teeth?,A journal article on the topic found a negligible (but non-zero) effect of carbonated waters on tooth enamel. The claim in the Daily Mail is clearly in dissonance with the results from this study.


  Dissolution levels with all of the mineral waters were very low and for several still waters were undetectable. (...) De-gassing of a sparkling mineral water reduced its dissolution, but the total levels were still relatively low suggesting that carbonation of drinks may not be an important factor per se in respect of erosive potential. The complex and heterogeneous mineral compositions of mineral waters could influence the dissolution equilibrium of apatite in enamel and controlled addition of several ions to ultrapure deionized water was investigated.


(source: J Oral Rehabil. 2001 Aug;28(8):766-72)

The idea that carbonated water harms teeth may be based on the fact that dissolving carbon dioxide in water results in some carbonic acid. However, this did not result significant enamel decay.


  When carbon dioxide is dissolved in water, small amounts of carbonic
  acid are formed, making the water slightly more acidic. However, when
  researchers soaked human teeth in various still and sparkling waters,
  they found that neither were harmful to the teeth.

Does drinking any type of soda increase the risk of Type 2 Diabetes?,Evidence through research shows that consumption of sugar sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit juice is associated with risk of diabetes but this simple correlation does not imply causation. No study has estimated how many diabetes cases can be caused by consuming sugar sweetened beverages. Research through observational studies continuously show that artificially sweetened beverages and fruit juice are not healthy options for the prevention of type 2 diabetes.


A metanalysis by Fumiaki Imamura et.al. in 2015 found that habitual consumption of sugar sweetened beverages was associated with a greater incidence of type 2 diabetes.



  Conclusions: Habitual consumption of sugar sweetened beverages was associated with a greater incidence of type 2 diabetes, independently of adiposity. Although artificially sweetened beverages and fruit juice also showed positive associations with incidence of type 2 diabetes, the findings were likely to involve bias. None the less, both artificially sweetened beverages and fruit juice were unlikely to be healthy alternatives to sugar sweetened beverages for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Under assumption of causality, consumption of sugar sweetened beverages over years may be related to a substantial number of cases of new onset diabetes.



Sakurai M et.al. in 2014 found that consumption of diet soda in a study of 2,037 Japanese men was significantly associated with an increased risk for diabetes. 



  Conclusions: Consumption of diet soda was significantly associated with an increased risk for diabetes in Japanese men. Diet soda is not always effective at preventing type 2 diabetes even though it is a zero-calorie drink.



In a Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis in 2009, diet soda consumption was positively associated with both metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.



  In MESA, diet soda consumption was positively associated with both incident metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Associations between diet soda and risk of type 2 diabetes were of greater magnitude than the associations observed between diet soda and metabolic syndrome. Despite accumulating evidence of the existence of these associations, we are cautious not to conclude causality between diet soda and the diabetic or pre-diabetic condition. The possibility of confounding by other dietary and lifestyle/behavioral factors cannot be excluded from these observational studies.

Has a meat substitute from human feces been developed in Japan?,This appears to be inspired by Japan vs. Korea disputes that continue to plague us.

According to Yahoo News Japan...


  "Japanese people create meat from human
  feces; Korean net users say
  'President's office should buy'"
  
  According to the Korean "No Cut News",
  a Japanese scientist has created "dung
  meat" out of human feces. It is said
  to be high in nutritious value. This
  news has hit the Korean web by storm,
  and many Korean Internet users are
  taking the opportunity to take jabs at
  the Korean government. Reported by
  China Net Japanese.
  
  According to the report, Japanese
  scientist Ikeda Mitsuyuki has
  determined in reprocessing experiments
  that human feces are rich in proteins,
  and has created edible "dung meat".
  Ikeda explains, "This dung meat is
  comprised of proteins distilled from
  human feces, along with bean products
  and beef. It tastes the same as beef."
  
  This "meat" contains 63% protein as
  well as 25% carbohydrates. It is thus
  highly nutritious, and costs 10 to 20
  times more than normal meat.
  
  There has been a large response on
  Korean portal site "Daum". One user
  made a comment regarding Korean
  government officials, stating "The
  Government house should buy a ton of
  this dung meat. I'd like to see them
  set up cameras in their cafeterias and
  televise their meals. It'd be fun to
  watch the government eat sh#t."
  
  Another user writes, "Japanese
  scientists are able to make food out
  of sh#t. They are clearly very
  technologically advanced. Korean
  scientists have a lot to learn from
  them."
  
  (Edited by Yonehara Yuko)


Not surprisingly, the comments are full of racism towards Koreans.


  This Japanese scientist is well aware of the Koreans' tastes.
  
  You'd report this? How stupid do you have to be?
  
  'cuz the Koreans love their dung wine, right? lol, it's perfect.
  
  To hell with all that K-Pop and Korean dramas they show in the Japanese media. Start showing them all this stuff!
  
  You want to steal it from us again and sell it as a Korean delicacy along with ttongsul, don't you? Be my guest, you can have this one.


Regarding the ttongsul in the last comment, it's a dung wine that's rumored in Japan to be a delicacy in Korea. The story there is disgustingly symmetrical (forgive me if my translation is incorrect; my Korean is terrible and Naver Dictionary/Translate can only help so much):


  "Koreans drink 'ttongsul (dung wine)',
  says Japanese article"
  
  There is commotion on a popular
  Japanese portal site regarding an
  article that states falsely that
  "Koreans enjoy ttongsul".
  
  Japanese blog news site "Rocket News
  24" wrote last July 31st entitled
  "What does Korean human feces wine
  'ttongsul' taste like?". It writes of
  how a Japanese woman learned of this
  supposedly traditional Korean wine. It
  also describes how this ttongsul is
  supposedly manufactured.
  
  The article writes that it is an item
  of Chinese (Oriental) medicine, and
  that people still drink it
  recreationally, especially in the
  countryside. The article was published
  on popular Japanese search portal site
  Livedoor. It is based on a blog post
  by a Japanese woman who apparently
  married in Korea, and was told of this
  by her husband.
  
  According to historical documents,
  ttongsul has indeed existed, and was
  used to treat blood congestion as well
  as back pain. Dog and bird feces were
  also said to be used to make wine.
  However, it would not be an
  overstatement to say that virtually no
  one drinks such wines now, being used
  only as fertilizer in some cases.
  
  Netizens express disbelief that such a
  fallacious article could reach the top
  of Japan's most popular portal site.


So, this "dung meat" rumor is likely a retaliatory effort by some faceless troll.

This pisses me off beyond words -- not because the "dung meat" thing is so racist, but because the Japanese are going to believe they're justified in their rampant belligerent racist attitudes when in fact we've been pulling this exact same nonsense the whole time -- and evidently aren't even admitting to it despite being aware of the fact.

If there are any Koreans reading this, I'm sorry that you have to put up with this. This is extremely disheartening. Because you know what? We started it.

Does drinking coffee interfere with magnesium absorption?,The Recommended Dietary Allowance for magnesium for adult males is 400 mg (Office of Dietary Supplements at NIH.gov). One cup of coffee has 10 mg of magnesium (USDA.gov), which does not really make it a good source.

In some papers, they are claims like: 


  ...Mg levels are decreased by excess ethanol, salt, phosphoric acid
  (sodas) and coffee intake...(Medical Hypotheses, 2001)


Some diagnostic guidelines, such as the one in this review article Challenges in the Diagnosis of Magnesium Status (Nutrients, 2018) suggest that coffee consumption is a minor criteria in assessment of magnesium status. The article links to a small 1994 study, according to which coffee consumption may result in minor net loss of magnesium via the urine.

Here's another small study that says that magnesium loss in urine can be due to increased diuresis triggered by caffeine:


  ...caffeine-induced urinary loss of calcium and magnesium is largely
  attributable to a reduction in calcium and magnesium renal
  reabsorption...


This means that some magnesium loss can be expected mainly in caffeine-naive users who haven't developed tolerance to caffeine's diuretic effect (as opposed to regular coffee drinkers who usually have). 

Several comprehensive articles about magnesium do not mention any interaction between coffee consumption and magnesium (Linus Pauling Institute, Office of Dietary Supplements, MedlinePlus, Drugs.com).

In conclusion, there does not seem to be enough evidence to worry that the intake of usual amounts of coffee would significantly affect magnesium status in your body.

Do antioxidants have health benefits?,This is a very interesting question, that has been extensively studied and has received great attention. As such, it has often been vandalized by generic press, leaving people quite confused on the matter. 

That antioxidants have physiological effects I would say needs no proof: our body utilises antioxidants such as ascorbate (vitamin C) to keep down the amount of free radicals, as can be confirmed by any basic physiology textbook (I can provide references if you need).

To get to the actual point of your question: do antioxidants have the "ability to prevent strokes"? I don't know if the article you read specifically used those words, but this is the type of bad "generic press talk" I was referring to...
Antioxidants do not prevent stroke. You can live a super-healthy life, take tons of antioxidants, exercise every day and still have a stroke. 

What certain antioxidants can do is to reduce the possibility of having a stroke, which is a very different thing. This is mostly due to the fact that oxidative stress is a risk factor for different cardiovascular diseases.

In the same line of thought, certain antioxidants, in certain regimes and certain situations can help fighting cancer. They DO NOT CURE cancer by themselves, I cannot stress this enough. Again, the idea is that free radicals can damage DNA increasing the risk of cancer. Free radical do not provoke cancer, but they can be a risk factor.

Same for neurodegenerative diseases and many other illnesses where antioxidants can help in certain cases.

It is difficult to generalize because stroke, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases are very broad category of illnesses, that can have the most disparate etiologies. So free radicals are not always the issue and antioxidants are not always the solution. Also, free radicals are actively used by our bodies (e.g. during immune responses) so excess antioxidants is not necessarily good.

The scientific literature at this regard is simply huge and it would be difficult to have a complete bibliography here. Here's a sample of papers and reviews at this regard, if someone who is more in the field knows better papers/reviews please feel free to update my answer (sorry most of these are limited access papers).

Air pollution: mechanisms of neuroinflammation and CNS disease. - Block and Calderón-Garcidueñas, Trends Neurosci., 2009

and there is many many more.

Not all antioxidants are good, however. For instance, this paper talks about the role of the transcription factor Nrf2, a factor which is involved in the physiological control of free radicals (so we can, by extension, call it an antioxidant inducing factor). The authors show that excess activation of Nrf2 does actually induce tumorigenesis rather then prevent it.

Is it healthier to heat your tea in the microwave?,tl;dr-  The research in question claims that microwaving can increase extraction of several compounds in tea; presumably, the news report assumes that these compounds are healthy.  Despite the news report's wording, there's no conclusive evidence that the compounds extracted from tea are healthy, as stated in daniel's answer; this position seems to be shared by the researchers who describe the health benefits as "potential".

The quoted author publishes a separate paper discussing links to health benefits, but he also publishes a third paper that says that caffeine can have a negative impact on some people.  The paper on potential health benefits also discusses potential health hazards.

Overall, the researchers are reporting that microwaving tea can help increase the amount of several of the chemicals of interest by about ~20% vs. their baseline preparation method.  It appears that the researchers suspect that one of these chemicals, catechins, is potentially quite desirable, and this suspicion seems to form the cornerstone of their interest in human health.



Health benefits not claimed; merely potential

The paper that this news story is based on appears to be "Improved extraction of green tea components from teabags using the microwave oven" (2012), Quan Vuong et al..

Its abstract begins:


  Abstract
   The green tea (Camellia sinensis) catechins are strong antioxidants linked with potential health benefits. Based on previous studies, it was hypothesised that the typical household conditions for brewing green tea in a teabag – 200 mL freshly boiled water for 2–3 min, as per the manufacturers’ instructions – were not sufficient to extract all the catechins and that a household microwave oven could be used to improve the extraction.


So, from that first line, the authors claim that these compounds in green tea have "potential health benefits"; they don't actually make the claim that they do have health benefits.

Possible health benefits explored in separate paper

Separately, in "Epidemiological Evidence Linking Tea Consumption to Human Health: A Review" (2012) by Quan Vuong (and him only, as opposed to with a group of others as in the prior paper):


  Abstract
  
  Tea has been widely consumed around the world for thousands of years and drinking tea is a daily habit for people of all ages. Tea is a major source of flavanoids, which have become well known as antioxidants. Tea also contains caffeine and theanine, which have been found to associate with health benefits. Many animal and epidemiological studies have been conducted to investigate the link between tea consumption and human health. However, common questions that arise about tea consumption include: whether all teas are the same, why drinking tea is linked with health benefits, how do the different ways of tea preparation impact on availability of tea components, how much and how long a person should consume tea to obtain health benefits, and whether there is any negative health effect associated with drinking tea. To answer these questions, this paper outlines the tea components and their link to human health, discusses major factors affecting availability of tea components in a tea cup, and reviews the latest epidemiological evidence linking tea consumption to human health.


An analysis and characterization of the links and evidence is beyond the scope of this answer, however it's probably sufficient to say that the paper includes:


  Several epidemiology studies have reported the association between tea consumption and health benefits. However, the volume of tea required for obtaining health benefits is an area of speculation.


Since the original paper was about increasing the effective amount of chemicals released by tea by ~20%, the health benefits would seem to material if that ~20% is the difference in a volume that's less healthy vs. a volume that's more healthy; and as the authors say that'd fall into "an area of speculation".

In this paper's conclusions section:


  Results from epidemiological studies were inconsistent and thus it is difficult to conclude how much of tea a day and how long a person should consume tea to obtain the health benefits.


Caffeinated tea can be unhealthy for some

The same author goes on to publish "Caffeine in Green Tea: Its Removal and Isolation" (2013) by Quan Vuong and Paul Roach, in which the abstract begins:


  Abstract
   Green tea is a rich source of the strong antioxidants, the catechins, but it also contains high levels of caffeine, which may cause negative effects in some people and this has led to a demand for decaffeinated green tea.


Since the first paper claims that microwaving increases the amount of caffeine released from 76% to 92%, it stands to reason that microwaving tea can make it less healthy for some.

Other potential issues

The second paper cited above, on the potential health benefits of tea, also discusses some of the potential negative impacts (beyond that of caffeine).  Figure 1 from that paper shows a pathway to potentially increased cancer rates, while they also discuss the potential for the sugars in tea to contribute to diabetes.  However, these effects are also quite speculative.

It is quite interesting to read and I don't want to pick out any specific parts of their discussion, but the conclusion is: "In terms of moderate beer drinking, our results are consistent with the literature, which suggests that the association between beer and obesity, if it exists, is probably weak."

  "The ingrained misconception linking egg consumption to high blood cholesterol and heart disease must be corrected.

Is graphology grounded?,The seminal review on graphology is "Illusory Correlations in Graphological Inference" by Roy N. King and Derek J. Koehler, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology.

The study supports two major conclusions. (1) A meta-review of the literature finds "overwhelming evidence" against the predictive validity of graphology. (2) "Semantic association between words used to describe handwriting features and personality traits was the source of biases in perceived correlation" between hand-writing and personality.

In other words: the science of graphology is junk, but people continue to believe it because words used to describe handwriting (e.g. messy, unclear, neat, confused, meticulous) can so easily be used to pass judgement on the person.

Why the French in particular disregard the science for superstition is a topic for another question.

Are "ectomorph", "mesomorph" and "endomorph" valid and useful descriptors?,The sources I find suggest that the validity of the theory is still up for debate (surprisingly). 

This NY Times article dismisses the theory:


  Later, other photographs were taken by W. H. Sheldon, a researcher who believed that there was a relationship between body shape and intelligence and other traits.
  
  Mr. Sheldon has since died, and his work has long been dismissed by most scientists as quackery. 


and there's a more detailed, academic critique here.

At the same time, academic researchers are conducting empirical studies as recently as 2013  that appear to confirm Sheldon's hypothesis:


  The questionnaire was administered to 242 (two 
  hundred and forty two) University of The Gambia students by stratified sampling technique based on body types 
  (whether endomorph, mesomorph or ectomorph). The physical body type an individual possesses has an 
  influence on the behaviour or personality of that individual, as posited by Sheldon’s constitutional theory. This 
  was confirmed, even when applied in the African society specifically in The Gambia, by this study. [emphasis mine]


Here's a 2006 paper making similar claims:


  Investigated whether measures of personality considered compositely and individually differ significantly among groups differentiated according to self-perceived somatotype (PSS). The Bodv Cathexis Scale, Eysenck Personality Inventory, and Tennessee Self-Concept Scale were employed to assess personality in 285 college males, and the indices of somatotype were measured using the Perceived Somatotype Scale. MANOVA revealed significant differences in global personality among the groups. Univariate analyses indicated that the PSS groups differed significantly in self-concept, extraversion, neuroticism, and body cathexis, while the PSI groups differed significantly in extraversion. Apparently, the male personality is partly a function of the body build perceived as self, the image viewed as ideal, and whether a discrepancy exists between the figures perceived as self and ideal.


And here's a third, from 2010:


  After examining the relativity between personal measurement categories of the subjects and character type through the MBTI, Extraversion(E) type showed inverse correlation in stature, height, biacromial breadth, and subcutaneous fat thickness of posterior iliospinale. Contrary to the E type, the Introversion(I) type showed positive correlation. Sensing(S) type showed inverse correlation only in biacromial breadth, Intuition(N) type showed positive correlation in most categories including height, width and the subcutaneous fat thickness. Thinking(T) type showed positive correlation in bust point-bust point, chest depth and hip width. Feeling(F) type, on the other hand, showed inverse correlation. The Judging(J) type showed inverse correlation in stature, height, length and the parts of chest. In contrast, Perceiving(P) type showed positive correlation in other categories including biacromial breadth, same as the J type.


A Google scholar search for "Somatotype personality", limited to publications since 2010, produces almost 500 results, which suggests this is still an active area of research.

Additional caveat: I am not qualified to assess whether the research present is correcting for discipline appropriate factors, and thus whether their findings are valid. However, taken at face value, it looks like there is some relationship between somatotype and personality, and all of these papers are referencing the theory. Some of them are using more detailed measurements however.  

EDIT: Some additional information in response to one of the comments: Yes, one's somatotype can change over time, for at least some groups (I speculate: for anyone). For example, see this study, in which 67% of subjects changed dominant somatotypes during puberty.

Can a trained human eye catch microexpressions?,Lets start with the eyes and perception [1].


  The human eye and its brain interface, the human visual system, can
  process 10 to 12 separate images per second, perceiving them
  individually. The visual cortex holds onto one image for about
  one-fifteenth of a second, so if another image is received during that
  period an illusion of continuity is created, allowing a sequence of
  still images to give the impression of motion.


From this stance, it's certainly possible to to detect motion by at least 1/10 of a second (perhaps a twitch).  

The other part of this is determination of if the movement was involuntary or not, which is more or less a trained art. 

Another type of microexpression is auditory microexpressions, which involves detection in the form of involuntary inflections of pitch in your in somebody's voice.  First, the biology of the ear [2]:


  The inner ear, called the cochlea, has a remarkable thin compliant
  membrane stretched out along inside it. This membrane is called the
  basilar membrane, and it has two really interesting features. First,
  it is resonant at different frequencies at different points along its
  surface, and second, it is infused with thousands of nerve endings
  (called hair cells) that are attached to the auditory nerve going to
  the brain.   
  
  The net effect of these two features is that different
  frequencies excite different hair cells, so that in a general (if
  incomplete) way we can think of the mechanism as causing each hair
  cell to be excited by a very specific range of frequencies. This leads
  us to a concept called the "place" theory of pitch detection.


Secondly how we perceive sound:


  The shortest sound we can hear is an impulse about 20
  microseconds long. This is related, of course, to the upper limit of
  frequencies, about 20,000 Hz. We can theoretically hear sounds that
  are indefinitely long. However, from a perceptual standpoint they
  cease to be perceived as events and instead become “a continuum.”
  ...
  
  Meanwhile, the sound events
  (like musical notes and spoken words) that we work with in audio are
  generally between 50 milliseconds (1/20th of a second) and five
  seconds long.   There are two other primary things to know about the
  time dimension. The first is that there is a fundamental neurological
  boundary for humans at about 50 milliseconds. Events occurring more
  quickly than that are perceived as a single or continuous event, not
  as a series of events. Events occurring less quickly are perceived as
  separate individual events. This holds true for vision as well (hence
  our 30 fps rate for film). So as I noted earlier, a 5 Hz square wave
  will be heard as a series of clicks, while a 50 Hz square wave will be
  heard as a continuous tone.   The other time phenomenon worth keeping
  in mind is our integration time. When we perceive “a sound,” we
  integrate all of the versions of that sound that occur within the
  first 50 milliseconds of the sound into a single holistic perception.
  So we sort of average all versions of a sound that occur during that
  period to produce our conscious perception of the sound source. We
  will discuss this at considerable length in later articles.   Finally,
  we have to keep in mind that frequencies are a subset of the time
  dimension. Individual pitched (periodic) sounds consist of an array of
  frequencies, as I mentioned above. The lowest such frequencies
  (fundamentals) usually fall within a four octave range from about 60
  Hz to 1 kHz All frequencies above 1 kHz can be regarded as harmonics
  that enable us to determine timbre and differentiate sounds from each
  other.


This latter part of about perception of sound is rather interesting when compbined with visual microexpression.  The two sences seem to enhance one another if experienced simultaneously (ie, face to face conversations).

There is certainly potential for detection, but it's up to perceiver to decide whether it is indeed a microexpression.  So what's the success rate in determining of a trained eye?  Taken from the book "The Philosophy of Deceptions" and it's research, we find:


  Measurements we have made of facial movements, voice, and speach show
  that high levels of accuracy are possible - over 80 percent correct
  classifications of who is lying and who is telling the truct.  While
  making those measurements required slow-motion replays, we also know
  that accurate judgments are possible just by viewing the videotapes. A
  small percent of thos we have studied have reached 80 percent or
  better accuracy, and tey have done so in more than one scenario, so it
  unlikely that their accuracy was a fluke (O'Sullivan and Ekman 2005).


So, more often than not, a human eye CAN catch microexpressions in real-time.

Is Tuesday a better day for Press Releases and similar information?,It depends what sort of press release you are talking about. You may like to focus the question more.

For example, in a recent document, three accountancy researchers claim:

While there is considerable research on the timing of
interim and annual financial reports, there is a scarcity of research on the timing of nonperiodic disclosures.

Reference: 
Balatbat, Maria C. A., Gallery, Gerry Thomas and Jackson, Andrew B., The Strategic Timing of Management Earnings Forecasts (February 15, 2011)

They go on to provide evidence that organisations do deliberately delay financial disclosures to hit certain days of the week.

Are Facebook Likes similar to cocaine addiction?,** EDITED to reflect edits to the question and discussion in comments. **

Everything in the article seems credible, and doesn't seem to contradict other sources. It does seem guilty of sensationalising the subject because there doesn't seem to be any unique link here - you can could equally draw similarities with love, food, sex, sports or many other things.

Certainly we can say there are some similarities between facebook feedback and cocaine use which are backed up by scientific studies, such as this study published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience in which researchers used Functional MRI scans to establish that positive feedback on Facebook does stimulate the reward centre in the brain.


  Positive Facebook feedback seen as a 'reward' in brain
  
  The findings of
  the study revealed that participants who gained positive feedback
  about themselves showed stronger activity within the nucleus accumbens
  compared with when they saw another person receiving positive
  feedback. This corresponded with the subjects' intensity of Facebook
  use.
  
  http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265509.php


Cocaine use and many other things also stimulate the reward area of the brain.  This article in the Journal of Advanced Practive Nursing says that love, cocaine and gambling are all similar:


  “When thinking about your beloved, there is intense activation in the
  reward area of the brain — the same area that lights up when you take
  cocaine, the same area that lights up when you win a lot of money.”
  
  
  http://www.asrn.org/journal-advanced-practice-nursing/813-love-pain-money-cocaine-light-up-same-area-of-brain.html
  


also 


  The drug achieves its main immediate psychological effect—the high—by causing a buildup of the neurochemical dopamine.
  
  
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851032/
  


and


  With the development of brain-imaging technologies it has been discovered that the 'highs' cocaine users experience is directly correlated with the degree to which cocaine binds to dopamine transporters (molecules which allow for the re-uptake of dopamine), especially in the nucleus accumbens. 
  
  
  http://www2.derby.ac.uk/ostrich/intro_to_bio_psych/addiction/page_11.htm
  


What I've established with these references appears to support some similarity of the immediate effects.  I don't want to draw conclusions which are not in the sources, and I'm not sure whether they are adequate to support the idea that the cumulative effect leads to addiction; perhaps we need more references to support that or perhaps an expert in addiction could confirm that this conclusion can be drawn.

TL;DR There is scientific evidence of the effect on the brain and there are some similarities to cocaine use.

Does reading about cognitive biases improve reasoning?,It's a little bit of a catch 22. When we tend to feel strongly that we are right, we quieten down the part of our brains that signal we might be wrong: 

So it follows that if we are confident we know all the biases because we're well read on the topic, we could very well be leaving ourselves open to an as-yet unknown bias or some other weakness in our reasoning. 

As a skeptic, by definition, I think it always helps to question, even the things we hold to be true.

Do men think about sex every 7 seconds?,Finally, someone has done a study that will provide an answer. The study, run by Dr Terri Fisher, asked 163 students to carry a tally counter, and note when they had thoughts about sex:

It won't be published until January 2012 so I have had to rely on early press reports, such as this one  in MedicalXpress:


  the research discredits the persistent stereotype that men think about sex every seven seconds, which would amount to more than 8,000 thoughts about sex in 16 waking hours. In the study, the median number of young men's thought about sex stood at almost 19 times per day. Young women in the study reported a median of nearly 10 thoughts about sex per day.
  
  [...]
  
  Correcting this stereotype about men's sexual thoughts is important, Fisher noted.
  "It's amazing the way people will spout off these fake statistics that men think about sex nearly constantly and so much more often than women do," she said. "When a man hears a statement like that, he might think there's something wrong with him because he's not spending that much time thinking about sexuality, and when women hear about this, if they spend significant time thinking about sex they might think there's something wrong with them." 


It's hard to properly evaluate the methodology and results before seeing it published; press reports are often inaccurate.

One aspect that concerns me is that it required student to notice that they were having these thoughts. Perhaps a better methodology would be a buzzer that rang randomly, and had the students record whether they were thinking about sex at the time, would have gotten better results.

Obviously, self-reporting about a taboo topic is another issue.



Update:

The article was published:

Meditation - Is it just spiritual practice or something more?,As Christian pointed out, meditation means a lot of different things. Even varieties of meditation differ within themselves; according to one account, mindfulness meditation practices differ along 5 dimensions:


  (1) intention and context of mindfulness practice, (2) bare attention, (3) attentional control, (4) wholesome emotions, and (5) ethical discernment


This leads to different effects depending on the style of meditation. Nonetheless, here are some of the findings:

Psychological effects

Meditation has been shown to be effective in self-regulation of many psychology factors including


  present-moment pain, negative body image, inhibition of activity by pain, symptoms, mood disturbance, and psychological symptomatology, including anxiety and depression.


Transcendental Meditation has been shown to be particularly effective in improving anxiety, though other forms of meditation also helped, to a lesser degree. 

Another review concluded that:


  Mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions appear to be effective in the treatment of depression, anxiety, psychosis, borderline personality disorder and suicidal/self-harm behaviour.


Also, ACT therapy, a relatively new form of cognitive-behavioural therapy based on mindfulness, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a number of issues, including psychosis, anxiety, depression, pain management, quitting smoking, and substance abuse. A re-analysis showed that ACT was even more effective than some existing treatments.

In contrast, another meta-analysis concluded that the effect of the mindfulness-based stress reduction program on depression and anxiety is not reliable:


  Evidence for a beneficial effect of MBSR on depression and anxiety was equivocal. When active control groups were used, MBSR did not show an effect on depression and anxiety. Adherence to the MBSR program was infrequently assessed. Where it was assessed, the relation between practising mindfulness and changes in depression and anxiety was equivocal. 


Neurological effects

This massive review summarises the research on neuroimaging studies of meditation and discusses the findings as they relate to psychological and clinical effects. The studies done to date show a number of changes to different areas of the brain, including frontal and prefrontal areas, which is linked with improvements to attention and information processing speed and efficiency. They conclude that effects on brain and nervous system function are undeniable, but due to differences in practice and research the exact nature of those effects requires more study.

Physiological effects

This review summarises some of the physiological effects linked directly to meditation (as opposed to those caused by e.g., simply resting), including changes to heart rate, blood flow, and metabolic processes.

Does technology have a negative effect on attention span?,Stanford did a study on this, the press release can be found here:
http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2009/multitask-research-release-082409.html


  People who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information do not pay attention, control their memory or switch from one job to another as well as those who prefer to complete one task at a time, a group of Stanford researchers has found.


I'm an avid reader of Cal Newport's blog. He's a very successful professor in computer science, and he credits his success to his emphasis on what he calls "deep work". Distraction-free hour-long efforts to get important things done. Being a scientist, he never fails to cite relevant research for his claims. Check out this recent post for a taste: http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/12/12/deep-habits-the-danger-of-pseudo-depth/


  Something that came up again and again when I was researching my book on this topic, is that switching your attention — even if only for a minute or two — can significantly impede your cognitive function for a long time to follow.
  
  More bluntly: context switches gunk up your brain.
  
  This effect has been validated from many angles in academic psychology and related fields, [...]


This partly answers the question. There are multiple differing claims here, but the thing regarding attention spans seems to be validated by the Stanford research.

Do people's IQs change?,IQ changes during childhood development are well known. See IQ Testing 101, page 218, for an example:


  Campbell et al. reported IQ gains from age 3 to 21 years.
  
  The gains during elementary and high school [...] were smaller than the short term gains but still substantial (4 points at age 8, 6 points at ages 6.4, 12, and 15).


From Ceci and Williams. Schooling, Intelligence, and Income:


staying in school can itself elevate one's IQ
children whose schooling was delayed experienced a decrement of five IQ points for every year that their schooling was delayed. 


Given that IQ does change throughout childhood, that should remove your incredulity about the study's results.

Do "scare kids straight" programmes reduce criminal activity?,According to this meta review the answer is a big, resounding no. Actually &ndash; it increases criminality.


  
  Petrosino and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis review of Scared Straight programs with the most rigorous methodological standards to date.  
  Meta-analysis results show the scared straight-type intervention increases the odds of offending by between 1.6 and 1.7 to 1 compared to a no-treatment control group. These findings lead the researchers to conclude that participating in the Scared Straight program actually correlates with an increase in re- offending compared to a control group of youth who received no intervention at all.1
  Other reviews of the research find deterrence-oriented programs ineffective in preventing crime (Lipsey, 1992; Sherman et al., 1997).

Do you feel pain in a life-threatening situation?,From Discovery Health - How can adrenaline help you lift a 3,500-pound car?


  When adrenaline is released by the
  adrenal medulla it allows blood to
  flow more easily to your  muscles.
  This means that more oxygen is carried
  to your muscles by the extra blood,
  which allows your muscles to function
  at elevated levels. 
  
  Adrenaline also facilitates the
  conversion of the body's fuel source
  (glycogen) into its fuel (glucose).
  This carbohydrate gives energy to
  muscles, and a sudden burst of glucose
  also allows muscles to strengthen
  further.


But of course an adrenaline rush can't boost your strength to infinity. Every body has physical (muscles, tendons, bones) limitations that can't be exceeded.

Do stress balls reduce stress?,&ldquo;Venting&rdquo; frustration in cathartic gestures like abusing stress balls only makes it worse. From Bushman, Baumeister, and Stack (1999):


  Contrary to the catharsis hypothesis... people who read the procatharsis message and then hit the punching bag were subsequently more aggressive than were people who read the anticatharsis message.
  
  Our findings suggest that media messages advocating catharsis may be worse than useless. They encourage people to vent their anger through aggressive action, and perhaps even foster the displacement of aggression toward new, innocent third parties.


More on Bushman's experiments:


  The people in both groups were told they were going to have to compete against the person who [angered&nbsp;them].  One group first had to punch a bag, and the other group had to sit and wait for two minutes.
  
  After the punching and waiting, the competition began.
  
  The game was simple, press a button as fast as you can. If you lose, you get blasted with a horrible noise. When you win, blast your opponent. They could set the volume the other person had to endure, a setting between zero and 10 with 10 being 105 decibels.
  
  Can you predict what they discovered?
  
  On average, the punching bag group set the volume as high as 8.5. The timeout group set it to 2.47.
  
  The people who got angry didn't release their anger on the punching bag, it was sustained by it. The group which cooled off lost their desire for vengeance.
  
  In subsequent studies where the subjects chose how much hot sauce the other person had to eat, the punching bag group piled it on. The cooled off group did not.
  
  When the punching bag group later did word puzzles where they had to fill in the blanks to words like ch_ _e, they were more likely to pick choke instead of chase.
  
  Bushman has been doing this research for a while, and it keeps turning up the same results.

Do murderers have "the eyes of a killer"?,The field of trying to work out a person's personality from their face is called Physiognomy.

Wikipedia claims:

It is now being revived again as some new research indicates that people's faces can indicate such traits as trustworthiness, social dominance and aggression. The latter trait seems to be determined by the level of the hormone testosterone during puberty, which affects the ratio between the height and width of the face - aggressive individuals are found to have wider faces.

There are references there about detecting people's political preferences too.

I would expect (without evidence) that detecting criminality would be swamped more by factors of clothes, cosmetics (including hairstyles and tattoos) and racial profiling than actual facial characteristics.

Does one's personality set in at seven year's old?,Here is the original study:


On the Contextual Independence of
Personality: Teachers’ Assessments
Predict Directly Observed Behavior
After Four Decades, 
DOI: 10.1177/1948550610370717.


I believe its conclusions have been rather mangled along the way, until you have reached a false conclusion.

You write: 


  Does one's personality set in at seven year's old?


The study does not say that. The study says that there are a larger number of correlations between teacher ratings of students in elementary school and scientist ratings of behaviour 40 years later than one might expect through chance alone.

For example, from the abstract:


  Early ‘‘adaptability’’ was associated with
  cheerful and intellectually curious behavior, early ‘‘impulsivity’’ was associated with later talkativeness and loud speech, and early rated
  tendencies to ‘‘self-minimize’’ were related to adult expressions of insecurity and humility.


You write: 


  I understand that the study says that personality can change, but it's hard.


The study does not say that. The LiveScience article attributes that to "previous research", linking to another page that gets closer to this claim, but still doesn't quite seem to make it.

You write: 


  Is this a large enough sample size?


Yes, it was a large enough sample size to demonstrate the effects that they claimed, which were very mild. This was demonstrated by a statistical analysis that showed the number of correlations was considerably higher than expected by chance alone.

You write:


  Were there any children whose personalities drastically changed?


This contains a fundamental misunderstanding of the research.

Firstly, practically every child has a drastically different personality 40 years later. They are more mature in numerous ways. If you found a 47-year-old with the personality of a 7-year-old, they would likely be in a mental institution.

Secondly, they didn't measure the same things - e.g. "impulsivity" was measured as a child, and "loud speech" was measured as an adult, and they were found to correlate. This study could not show that personalities were the same even if they were.

Thirdly, even the strongest correlations were fairly mild. e.g. one of the strongest correlations was between "Verbal Fluency" as a child and "Shows interest in intellectual/cognitive matters" as an adult, and it was r=0.30. Without giving a full lecture on how correlation works, an r-value of 0.30 indicates a mild tendency, not a strong prediction.

You write: 


  Are there any other studies that conclude differently?


I considered editing this question out, because it shows a strong bias. You should keep an open mind about which direction the evidence may take you.



In summary, the paper which triggered your concerns does not make the claims that you are concerned about.

Can the digit ratio predict personality or behavior?,Finger ratio is an indication of prenatal testosterone in relation to estradiol. In "2nd to 4th digit ratios, fetal testosterone and estradiol" Lutchmayaa et al report:


  Results: A significant negative association between right 2D:4D ratio and FT (fetal testosterone) /FE (fetal estradiol)  ratio, which was independent of sex. Conclusions: These preliminary findings lend support to an association between low 2D:4D and high levels of FT (fetal testosterone)  relative to FE (fetal estradiol), and high 2D:4D with low FT (fetal testosterone) relative to FE (fetal estradiol).


But it's also a predictor of current testosterone as shown in "The ratio of 2nd to 4th digit length: a predictor of sperm numbers and concentrations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone and oestrogen."


  The dimorphism is present from at least age 2 years and 2D:4D is probably established in utero; (ii) high 2D:4D ratio in right hands was associated with germ cell failure in men (P = 0.04); (iii) sperm number was negatively related to 2D:4D in the right hand (P = 0.004); (iv) in men testosterone concentrations were negatively related to right hand 2D:4D and in women and men LH (right hand), oestrogen (right and left hands) and prolactin (right hand) concentrations were positively correlated with 2D:4D ratio and (v) 2D:4D ratio in right hands remained positively related to luteinizing hormone and oestrogen after controlling for sex, age, height and weight.


Testorsterone has a lot to do with personality and therefore you can use the finger ratio as an imperfect predictor of personality.

Do women prefer taller men?,Based on the Wikipedia page on Physical Attractiveness, which is well referenced, this is true. 
Note however that it also says there that 


  While women usually desire men to be at least the same height as themselves or taller, several other factors also determine male attractiveness, and the male-taller norm is not universal. In certain non-Western cultures, the relative heights of partners have been shown to be irrelevant in their choice of mate, which suggests that Western height preferences may be sociocultural, rather than genetic, in nature. Professor Adam Eyre-Walker, from the University of Sussex, stated that there is, as yet, no evidence that these preferences are evolutionary preferences, as opposed to merely cultural preferences.

Are people more likely to give honest responses to surveys when anonymous?,A majority of the literature on the net seems to support that non-anonymous and anonymous-surveys give very similar results.

The paper "A comparison of confidential versus anonymous survey procedures: Effects on reporting of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs in a national study of students." studies anonymous vs. confidential surveys in a specific case (drug usage reported in 8th and 10th graders), and concluded that there was a very modest or possibly no effect on the data. 

From the abstract:


  This study presents a comparison of
  reporting of drug use and related
  attitudes and beliefs by national
  samples of 8th and 10th grade students
  under two different modes of
  administration conditions:
  confidential and anonymous. Data come
  from the Monitoring the Future project
  for the year 1998. The results show
  that there were clearly no differences
  between the conditions in 10th
  graders' reports of drug use and
  related attitudes and beliefs. With
  8th graders, the results show, at
  most, only a very modest mode of
  administration effect and quite
  possibly no effect at all.


The same conclusion is drawn in more countries in the paper "Adolescent Substance Abuse in Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United States: Effect of Anonymous versus Confidential Survey Formats".

  Anonymity had either no effect on

  that the respondents did not differ in
  their report of the incidence of

The surveys seem to

Non-anonymous may mean
    several things, perhaps each with
    it's own effect on results.

Are people happier when they spend money on experiences rather than physical objects?,Plenty of well-conceived research has been performed on objective happiness, which has given rise to interesting studies related to your question. These articles support the popular claim that more happiness can be derived from experiential purchases than material purchases:

"To Do or to Have? That Is the Question" (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Van Boven &amp; Gilovich, 2003):


  In two surveys,  respondents  from
  various demographic groups indicated that experiential purchases—those made with the primary intention of acquiring  a life experience— made them happier than material purchases.  In  a  follow-up
  laboratory experiment, participants experienced more positive feelings after pondering an experiential
  purchase than after pondering a material purchase. In another experiment, participants were more likely
  to anticipate that experiences would make them happier than material possessions after adopting a
  temporally distant, versus a temporally proximate, perspective.


"Experientialism, Materialism, and the Pursuit of Happiness" (Review of General Psychology, Van Boven, 2005):


  Respondents  to  various  surveys  have  indicated  that  purchases  made  with  the  intention  of
  acquiring life experiences make them happier than purchases made with the intention
  of acquiring material possessions. Thinking about experiential purchases has also been
  shown to produce more positive feelings than thinking about material purchases. Other
  studies suggest that experiential purchases make people happier because they are more
  open to positive reinterpretations, are more resistant to disadvantageous comparisons,
  and foster successful social relationships more than material purchases.


"Happiness from Ordinary and Extraordinary Experiences" (Journal of Consumer Research, Bhattacharjee &amp; Mogilner, 2014):


  Prior research indicates that experiences bring greater happiness than material possessions, but which experiences result in the greatest happiness? (...) Younger people, who view their future as extensive, gain more happiness from extraordinary experiences; however, ordinary experiences become increasingly associated with happiness as people get older, such that they produce as much happiness as extraordinary experiences when individuals have limited time remaining. Self-definition drives these effects: although extraordinary experiences are self-defining throughout one's lifespan, as people get older they increasingly define themselves by the ordinary experiences that comprise their daily lives.

Are first impressions unchangeable?,I did not find the study you mentioned, but I know a very similar classic (371 citations on Google Scholar). Maybe you meant Ambady &amp; Rosenthal (1993).

They used the thin slices paradigm (showing people very small amounts of information/behaviour) and predicted end-of-the-semester student evaluations. The people who saw the short video clips were different from the students.


  In the 1st study, consensual [aggregated across 9 student raters (in their first study)] judgments of college teachers' molar nonverbal behavior based on very brief (under 30 s) silent video clips significantly predicted global end-of-semester student evaluations of teachers.


So they significantly predicted them and some of the correlations were quite large (.84 for optimism). Some correlations weren't significant, so this is of course not in the realm of "there was practically no difference" (quoting you), but it's also a different study.

This wasn't such a small sample to begin with (13 teachers, 8-20 students per class, so at least 104) and they varied it too (thinner slices, predicting principal's ratings of high school teachers). The paradigm is used quite often in different variations nowadays. You actually asked about a different study, so I didn't go in very deeply. Maybe you think my answer strays too far from the original question. 

Question two "Are first impressions a surprisingly good judge of character?":

Yes, this step has been taken, but I wouldn't call it surprisingly good. Peer ratings, even by friends, aren't usually highly correlated with self-reported personality.

There is a classic meta-analysis about thin slices by Ambady &amp; Rosenthal (1992). They found no increase in accuracy of predictions of various objective outcomes after half a minute (to 5 minutes).
It's contradicted Carney, Colvin, &amp; Hall (2007) who found that accuracy increased with exposure time, which they varied from 5s to 5min (peak for extraversion after 5 min clip .55). 
Extraversion after 20 seconds was .41 correlated with self-report. I don't know if you consider this "surprisingly good".
The results are different for less obvious traits (openness).

Are first impressions unchangeable?

Srivastava, Guglielmo, &amp; Beer (2010) (great names, simply great names) found that stability of perceiver effects (peer ratings in students) increases over time. Across the Big Five: Week 1-2: .37; Week 2-3: .55, Week 3-4: .65.
So, they are certainly not unchangeable.

Does learning immediately before going to sleep increase the effect?,The website you quote makes it sound like the subconsciousness is a little man in your brain, with a book of knowledge, reviewing all the material during the night and "strengthening knowledge without your influence". Although the website doesn't properly support the idea about how post-training sleep might benefit memory consolidation, it does convey some "truth".

Gais et al. 1 studied the timing of learning, sleep and subsequent recall, and indeed found that when learning is immediately followed by sleep, this improves subsequent recall as compared to conditions in which learning was followed by wakefulness.

The task involved learning German words. In the picture below you can see the different conditions that were tested. In the first experiment (A) Gais tested whether sleep following learning or wakefulness following learning enhanced the consolidation of declarative memory (morning vs. evening). When comparing the different conditions, the evening-learning condition revealed a better performance than the morning condition.

To control for time-of-day effects a second experiment (B) was conducted, consisting of 2 evening conditions. One evening condition where learning was immediately followed by sleep and another evening condition where sleep was postponed until the morning hours. Again results favoured learning when it was immediately followed by sleep. 

(source: cshlp.org)  

Some mechanisms by which the role of sleep following learning (and the role of sleep in learning in general) might be explained are "memory replay" during sleep (neuronal activity reflecting the learning of a certain task during the day, re-occuring during the night), and/or synaptic downscaling (the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis).


  The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis... predicts that sleep may enhance
  performance by global downscaling...


For more background information read the review of Tononi &amp; Cirello 3, or a recent review by Ribeiro 4.

Now... what about these 15-20 minutes? Well I don't know where this advice comes from and don't know about scientific support for this claim. In the study of Gais the duration of learning (although not exactly mentioned) was "a few hours". I would say they are advantages and disadvantages to a learning period of 15-20 minutes as opposed to a longer learning period.

15-20 minutes rehearsal seems ideal in the sense that you'll be focusing on a limited amount of information. Strengthening this limited amount of information might increase their chances of being retained (I think this idea could be integrated with the synaptic downscaling hypothesis). When keeping study time or learning time shorter you might be able to increase focus. Keeping focus for a long time is more difficult and the efficiency by which one learns might decrease. However, you can also choose to learn for a longer time on a limited amount of information, thus increasing repetition and again increasing chances of the information being retained. It more or less depends on how you spend the time learning... 

In addition, the above mentioned claims might depend on what type of information you want to retain. Studies might report contradicting results, depending on what type of material is to be learned. E.g. complex material requires more investment. Also learning requires time... one has to invest in understanding the material and there are different strategies by which one can try to learn material that aren't covered in the studies. 

Personally I believe studies related to learning and sleep are really interesting to decipher what happens to the information we collect during the day. What happens during the part of the day where we are the least conscious of what's happening around us? When it comes to learning in itself however... I think it's more important to think about "how" you learn the material and how often you repeat learning the material, than the timing of learning in relation to sleep (e.g. paper on memory retrieval by Karpicke and Blunt 4).

Are psychopaths more intelligent than people in general?,TL;D/R: Psychopathic criminals are no more intelligent than non-psychopathic criminals, but the highly intelligent ones are more likely to commit serious crimes.



The connection between psychopathy and intelligence is slight complicated. There were conflicting reports about whether psychopaths were more intelligent, or the same intelligence, as other criminals. [Note: They were compared to non-psychopathic criminals, not the general population which is what the question was about; I hope this is close enough.]

A Swedish study tried to tease out some of the complexity.


Johansson P, Kerr M, Psychopathy and intelligence: a second look., J Pers Disord. 2005 Aug;19(4):357-69. PMID: 16178679


In the abstract, they explain the conflict:


  Empirical studies using the PCL-R (Hare, 2003) have shown no intelligence differences between psychopaths and nonpsychopaths. However, Cleckley (1976) argued that psychopaths often show superior intelligence. 


The study explored whether:


  the correlation between intelligence and severity of criminal development is the opposite in psychopaths than in nonpsychopathic criminals using a sample of 370 men sentenced for violent (nonsexual) crimes. That pattern would provide a way of explaining the discrepancy between Cleckley's view and later empirical work. 


And concluded: 


  for nonpsychopaths, higher total IQ and particularly verbal intelligence meant a later start in violent crime. For those diagnosed as psychopaths, however, this association was reversed.


The paper was further written up in Crime Times where they had more quotes from the authors.


  "The key finding in this study is that psychopathic and non-psychopathic criminals, although not different in overall levels of intelligence, did differ in how high intelligence was related to the seriousness of misbehavior. For non-psychopaths, higher intelligence, particularly verbal intelligence, meant a later start in violent crime. For those diagnosed as psychopaths, however, high intelligence meant an early start in violent offending and more problematic behavior in and outside of institutions."

Do 40% of U.S. Americans think that global warming is unproblematic since Christ will return soon?,The&nbsp;40% figure most likely comes from Pew Research Center:


  By the year 2050, 41% of Americans believe that Jesus Christ definitely (23%) or probably (18%) will have returned to earth. 


The figures can be seen here:



However, Pew does not make the global warming implication. 

There is a study by Barker and Bearce about this:


  the authors show that believers in Christian end-times theology are less likely to support policies designed to curb global warming than are other Americans. Barker and Bearce, End-Times Theology, the Shadow of the Future, and Public Resistance to Addressing Global Climate Change


I do not have full access to the paper, but Religion Dispatches quotes it as:


  a belief in the Second Coming reduces the probability of strongly agreeing that the government should take action by more than 12 percent.


The article is written by a professor doing research on evangelism and climate change. She disagrees with the conclusion that a belief in Christ’s return is the only or main reason for believing that global warming is unproblematic.

As it seems that Chomsky is using the Pew numbers, and as it is fair to assume that at least some people believing in the probability of a second coming may still worry about global warming, I wouldn't rate the claim as given as accurate.

Does CO2 cause Global Warming?,
  The Earth’s greenhouse effect is a natural occurrence that helps regulate the temperature of our planet. When the Sun heats the Earth, some of this heat escapes back to space. The rest of the heat, also known as infrared radiation, is trapped in the atmosphere by clouds and greenhouse gases, such as water vapor and carbon dioxide. If all of these greenhouse gases were to suddenly disappear, our planet would be 60oF (33oC) colder and would not support life as we know it. Human activities have enhanced the natural greenhouse effect by adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, very likely (greater than 90 percent chance) causing the Earth’s average temperature to rise. These additional greenhouse gases come from burning fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil to power our cars, factories, power plants, homes, offices, and schools. Cutting down trees, generating waste and farming also produce greenhouse gases.

Is the United Kingdom funding forced sterilization in India to combat climate change?,According to the UK government, £174,500,790 was provide for Reproductive and Child Health Programme Phase II with a start date of 15 December 2006.

Then, according to an India government site, a cash inventive system was set up:


  Monetary Benefits (Compensation) after adopting permanent method of sterilization (w.e.f. 1 Nov 07): -
  
  NSV operated beneficiary gets Rs. 1100/- as a cash incentive.
  
  
  Female belonging to SC/ST/BPL category gets Rs. 600/- after abdominal/laparoscopic tubectomy.
  Female belonging to above poverty line category gets Rs. 250/- cash after tubectomy by ant method.
  While promoters/motivators (i.e. ANM/MPW/AWW/Gramsevak etc) gets Rs. 200/- &amp; Rs. 150/- as a cash incentive upon promoting a client for vasectomy &amp; tubectomy respectively.
  


So the program itself doesn't directly force people to be sterilized, but it pays private parties to "motivate" the people to be sterilized.  

For example, according to U.S.-U.K. Foreign Aid Tied to India’s Forced Sterilization Campaign:


  According to papers filed in the Supreme Court of India last month, the 53 women of low caste were recruited by government “motivators” who took them to a government middle school in Bihar this January. Anay Jumar Chowdhary, a government doctor, performed sterilizing procedures on the women, who were laid out on school desks and anaesthetized by untrained staff. He worked at night by the light of a flashlight and a single generator light bulb.
  
  “I tell you they treat them not as human beings, but as cattle or goats. They just cut and take out veins. They were bleeding profusely. It is butchery,” said Devika Biswas, a health-rights activist in Bihar with the Human Rights Law Network, who filed the petition in court along with videotaped evidence of the camp and affidavits from the women’s families.
  
  “All of them are forced,” Biswas told the Register. “Generally, the people in the village are very simple. They are very poor. Some of them married at the age of 12 or 13. They do not know what it means. They are told it will be good for them. They are not told it will make them permanently unable to bear children. No risks are explained to them.”


Devika Biswas v. Union of India &amp; Ors.[WP (C) 95/2012], Hon’ble Supreme Court of India adds:


  A fact-finding in Rajasthan’s Bundi district found that 42% of the women were not counseled about the permanency of the operation 


and 


  The Petition also brings to light the instances of illegal sterilisation in Orissa where 6% of the physically disabled and 8% of the mentally challenged women were forcefully sterilised.


A 16 September 2016 decision by the Supreme Court of India states:


  unrealistic targets have been set for sterilization procedures with the result that
   non-consensual and forced sterilizations are taking place


Additionally, articles like The uterus snatchers of Andhra explain how women were tricked into having their uteruses removed.

Are glaciers melting?,Summary


  Do these finds show that glaciers are, overall, not shrinking?


No. The estimated rate of change in the mass of glaciers in the Himalayas is 3+/-6 Gt/year. (1 Gt = 109 tonnes = 1012 kg.) Given this level of uncertainty, it is not certain that they are growing. The global rate of mass lost from glaciers overall is closer to -500±100 Gt/y (from Jacob et al 2012), which is much greater in magnitude than the changes observed in the Himalayas.


  Do these expanding glaciers show that there has not been any global warming?


No. Global warming is observed directly as the increase in surface temperature over time  (e.g. see Is the world warmer now than during the Medieval Warm Period?). The effects of global warming, including melting glaciers, do not affect conclusions whether or not the warming is actually occurring. But the global declines in ice mass are consistent with what is expected to occur in a warming world. 

Background

Glaciers lose mass through melting, ablation, and calving. In the popular press, the term "melting" is used to account for all three. Thus, saying that the glaciers are 'melting' is used as a way of saying that the amount of ice in the world - the size of the cryosphere - is decreasing. 

The mass of a glacier is dynamic - it changes through time: mass is lost to melting etc. and mass is gained through precipitation of ice and snow. A nice overview of glacial dynamics is provided by the IPCC (IPCC 2007 section 4.5.1). 

Evidence

In section 4.5.2, The IPCC concludes that the global mass of glaciers is decreasing. According to a recent estimate that is based on satellite measurements of changes in the earth's gravitational field, the cryosphere is losing ~500±100 Gt / year  of water per year (Jacob et al 2012).

Although not every single glacier is decreasing in size, the overall trend is decreasing. Jacob et al provide a nice synthesis of the variability among different parts of the cryosphere, as shown in the figure and table below.

Does 1°C warming increase the H2O content of the atmosphere by 7%?,I found this blog which links to this Guardian article. I can't find a source they have used, but it states at the bottom of the article that it was written in conjunction with the Met Office:


  globally water vapour increases by 7% for every degree centigrade of warming


Scientific America agrees, and references the claim to Peter Stott, from the Met Office.


  And for every 1-degree C (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) rise in temperature, the amount of moisture that the atmosphere can contain rises by 7 percent


In response to your secondary question of "If true, why wouldn't this cause the sea-level to decrease?" - Climate Central says that a 1.5C rise could cause a 2.9m sea level rise. This is significantly more than the reduction caused by increased humidity. So the 7% increase would cause the sea level to reduce (slightly), but the rise from other factors (expansion of water, and melting land ice caps) would quickly outstrip it.



As a sidebar, I do not know of Jeremy Rifkin, but the little I watched of the video you linked did not impress me. I would not take what he says as gospel (for example, just after he makes the 7% claim, he seems to start cherry picking different disasters that occured recently - this is not very scientific).

Is global warming impossible because of CO2's dilution?,No, it's not true.  Here's a 60-second explanation of global warming.

It's conservation of energy. Fourier asked in 1824: the earth receives a continuous stream of energy from the sun. Why doesn't it keep getting hotter and hotter?

The answer is that the earth also radiates heat into space. A warmer object radiates more heat, so the earth warms up to a temperature where the incoming solar energy and the outgoing thermal energy balance each other ("equilibrium temperature").

As long as the incoming energy and outgoing energy balance each other, the total amount of energy in the system (land, oceans, atmosphere) remains the same, and the climate remains stable.

Hasn't climate changed in the past? Yes: if the brightness of the sun changes, or if there's variations in the earth's orbit, or if the reflectiveness of the earth changes, or if volcanic activity changes the composition of the atmosphere, these can all affect the energy balance, and therefore make the equilibrium temperature higher or lower.

But we can measure all these things, and right now only one of them is changing dramatically: atmospheric composition. By digging up and burning vast quantities of fossil fuels, releasing fossil CO2 into the atmosphere, we've been acting like a giant super-volcano.

Tyndall reported in 1861 that carbon dioxide blocks thermal radiation. The CO2 molecules absorb thermal radiation and re-radiate it in all directions, so some of it goes back downward towards the earth.

You can measure this in a lab, as Tyndall did, by shining infrared through a vessel of CO2. You can see it in the atmosphere: we have satellite measurements showing that outgoing thermal radiation has declined since 1970.

So incoming energy > outgoing energy. Additional heat accumulates until a new, higher equilibrium temperature is reached.

It takes a long time for the actual temperature to catch up with the equilibrium temperature. (Tyndall: the atmosphere acts like a dam thrown across a stream, the water rises behind the dam until it reaches the top.) So even if we could stabilize the current CO2 level today, the temperature will continue to rise.

Novak's argument that CO2 molecules are too diluted to have a significant effect is incorrect. By reducing outgoing thermal radiation, the elevated CO2 level increases the equilibrium temperature at which incoming energy is balanced by outgoing thermal radiation. It has nothing to do with the temperature of the CO2 molecules themselves.

Because there's lots of random variation in temperature across the earth, what we see isn't a small uniform rise in temperature. Instead we see local or regional heat waves which are far hotter than in the past, like the 2003 heat wave in Europe which caused 70,000 premature deaths. For a more detailed view of the evidence of heat waves, see Hansen Sato Ruedy 2012. Figure 3 is especially remarkable.

Policy implications.

Does the logarithmic nature of global warming invalidate climate change claims?,The claim that "... the effectiveness of CO2 as a greenhouse gas diminishes logarithmically with increasing concentration and from the current level of ~390 ppmv, ..." and that "inconvenient fact" is "well disguised for any lay reader" is one of the more ridiculous climate skeptic claims I've seen.  The main metric used by climate scientists to describe the effect of carbon dioxide is called "climate sensitivity".  Equilibrium climate sensitivity is the amount of warming we expect to see resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2.  This directly tells you (provided you understand logarithms) that there is a logarithmic relationship between carbon dioxide concentrations.  If ECS is 2°C per doubling that means if we raise CO2 from the pre-industrial equilibrium concentration (i.e. up to 560ppm from 280ppm) then we would expect to see a 2°C temperature rise once the climate system had fully re-equilibriated.  However to get the next 2°C rise, you would need to double the atmospheric CO2 again (i.e. up to 1120 ppm) and to get a third 2°C increase you would need to double it again, up to 2240ppm.  

Note that log2(280) = 8.1293, log2(560) = 9.1293, log2(1120) = 10.1293 and log2(2240) = 11.1293, so if we have y=c*log2(x), each time we double x, y increased by c, which is why expressing climate sensitivity in °C per doubling is just saying that the relationship is logarithmic in a way that ought to be clear even to someone who doesn't know what a logarithm is.  The constant c in this equation is ECS, if you use a log to a different base (e.g. ln or log10) then the numeric value of c will be different, but the relationship is the same, it is just easier to explain in terms of log2.  This is hardly rocket science!

Clearly, there is a "diminishing returns" effect here, but (i) far from hiding it, the climatologists are explicitly pointing it out in a form more easily understood even than logarithms (ii) to get a 2°C rise, you would only need to double CO2 levels from the pre-industrial level of 280ppm, and we have raised it to 400ppm already, so this is far from impossible, given that estimates of ECS are around 1.5-4.5°C per doubling. 


  "there is high confidence that ECS is extremely unlikely less than
  1°C and medium confidence that the ECS is likely between 1.5°C and
  4.5°C and very unlikely greater than 6°C." IPCC AR5 WG1, page 924


Do a google scholar search for "climate sensitivity", or look for it in the index of the IPCC reports and read the relevent sections, far from being hushed up, climatologists talk about this a lot.  

Now of course the greenhouse effect is self-limiting, for a start for that not to be the case we would require the Sun's luminosity to be infinite (as CO2 affects the Earth's radiative balance, but ultimately the energy comes from the sun), or equivalently to allow an infinite timescale (which isn't possible either).  The Stefan-Boltzman law that says the power radiated per unit area rises with the fourth power of temperature is also a strongly limiting factor (but that doesn't rule out temperatures being very high due to the greenhouse effect, e.g. Venus, so that isn't much consolation ;o).

In short, a logarithmic relationship does not rule out a 2°C rise in global mean surface temperatures, double atmospheric CO2 concentrations a sufficient number of times and it will happen (once the radiative balance is restored, which doesn't happen immediately).  How many doublings this requires depends on the equilibrium climate sensitivity, and according to current scientific understanding (as articulated by the IPCC AR5 WG1 report) the answer is most likely one doubling (as the most probable value is a little over 2°C per doubling), but it could be less but it is very unlikely that the number is two or more doublings (as ECS below 1°C has been essentially ruled out).

Would avoiding the eating of meat stop global warming?,The meat industry is indeed a major contributor to global warming, and other environmental effects such as deforestation. 

However, it does not seem that stopping eating meat by itself is enough to stop global warming.

In Diet, Energy, and Global Warming by Gidon Eshel and Pamela A. Martin, the authors claim that moving from meat-based diet to a vegetarian diet saves about 6% of the greenhouse gas emissions:


  Conclusions 
  
  We examine the greenhouse gas emissions associated with plant- and animal-based diets, considering both direct and indirect emissions (i.e., CO2 emissions due to fossil fuel combustion, and methane and nitrous oxide CO2-equivalent emissions due to animal-based food production). We conclude that a person consuming a mixed diet with the mean American caloric content and composition causes the emissions of 1485 kg CO2-equivalent above the emissions associated with consuming the same number of calories, but from plant sources. Far from trivial, nationally this difference amounts to over 6% of the total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude by briefly addressing the public health safety of plant-based diets, and find no evidence for adverse effects.


Note that this study is based on US data - the effect would be smaller in places where current diet already includes less meat.

I don't know what level of CO2 emission reduction is needed to stop global warming. but the change of green house gas concentration between the beginning of the industrial revolution and today is about 40% (data from US Department of Energy) - much more than what will be saved from stopping the meat industry. This is a lot, but it doesn't appear enough.

Based on Target atmospheric CO2: Where should humanity aim?
A level of 350 PPM of CO2 is desired to stop global warming, while the current level is 385 PPM - a difference of about 8%.

This is much closer to the amount reached by the Diet, Energy, and Global Warming paper, but a similar study that takes into account global (and not just US) data is needed to get a real conclusion.

Is this refutation of Climate Change scientifically valid?,I'm no expert by any means, but I stumbled upon your question and did a little research myself.

From this source, it appears that the homogenisation of the temperature data is made to account for the difference between the reading, which is regional, and some variable which is not the climate, which may not be linked to the region. 

The goal appears to be the taking of data from the equipment at one location to create regional data that reflects the region, rather than the one point on the map where equipment is stationed.

This wiki page states: 


  Next to changes in the climate itself, raw climate records also contain non-climatic jumps and changes for example due to relocations or changes in instrumentation.


So homogenisation is an attempt to account for the errors induced by changes not induced by climate or weather.

On NASA's website, they have a FAQ page where they answer why raw data cannot be used. I am quoting the answer below:


  Just averaging the raw data would give results that are highly dependent on the particular locations (latitude and elevation) and reporting periods of the actual weather stations; such results would mostly reflect those accidental circumstances rather than yield meaningful information about our climate.


In addition, NASA states that their data is homogenised, as @RomaH mentioned, to account for the effect of urban warming in cities. Source

  One of the improvements — introduced in 1998 — was the implementation of a method to address the problem of urban warming: The urban and peri-urban (i.e., other than rural) stations are adjusted so that their long-term trend matches that of the mean of neighboring rural stations. Urban stations without nearby rural stations are dropped. This preserves local short-term variability without affecting long term trends. Originally, the classification of stations was based on population size near that station; the current analysis uses satellite-observed night lights to determine which stations are located in urban and peri-urban areas.


Regarding whether or not that makes Breitbart's argument a valid one, I don't have a definitive answer. Assuming that NASA's model has accurately accounted for factors affecting temperature change other than climate, then no, Breitbart's argument is not valid.

Can a strong solar storm knock out our power grids for months?,NASA says:


  Multi-ton transformers damaged by such a storm might take years to repair.


This effect has been observed on a small scale (nasa.gov):


  A similar flare on March 13, 1989, provoked geomagnetic storms that disrupted electric power transmission from the Hydro Québec generating station in Canada, blacking out most of the province and plunging 6 million people into darkness for 9 hours; aurora-induced power surges even melted power transformers in New Jersey.
  
  [...]
  
  Another Carrington-class flare would dwarf these events.


The Department of Homeland Security issued a risk assessment in 2011 that said (p. 3):


  Recent estimates state that 300 large extra-high-voltage transformers in the United States would be vulnerable to geomagnetically induced currents. Damage to an extra-high-voltage transformer from geomagnetically induced currents could take months or even a year to repair and cost in excess of $10 million.

Can magnets damage LCD screens?,Magnets affect electrons only when they are moving. The force on an electron in a magnetic field is proportional to its speed. If it is stationary, the force is zero. In LCD screens there are no moving electrons, except when the image changes, so there cannot be any effect with a steady display. Any effect during a moving display will be very small (because the electrons in and LCD cannot drift as they can in a CRT), and will disappear once the display is steady again.

The other problem with CRTs is that they can become permanently magnetised, and thus always affect electrons as they fly to the screen. That is why CRTs sometimes need to be de-gaussed. In LCDs there is nothing to magnetise (and no flying electrons) so this effect is also negligible.

Also, I noticed that both your links point out that LCDs will not be affected by magnetic fields (actually the Win 7 link says that any effect is too minor to be visible).

Do trackers hold their ears to the ground?,According to the 1832 book Six Months in America, volume II, at page 67:


  At certain seasons of the year, their tramping and bellowing may be heard at a vast distance on the plains, by putting the ear to the ground; and in this way, if heard in the morning, incredible as it may appear, it will sometimes be evening before the hunters can come up with them. 


in reference to bison hunting by native Americans.

And according to Technology for Diagnostic Sonography at page 11:


  Watching late-night western movies teaches that one does not listen for the sound of an oncoming train or a herd of buffalo in a normal standing position. Every youngster learned from old westerns that you put your ear to the rail or to the ground. The late John Wayne most likely would not have said, “Put your ear to the ground because that way you will eliminate the acoustic impedance mismatch and thus get a better sound transfer,” but he should have, for that is the case.

Does cold water boil faster than hot water?,No, according to Scientific American - Is it true that hot water freezes faster than cold water or that cold water boils faster than hot water? It seems hard to believe, but some people swear that it is so. (emphasize mine):


  Cold water does not boil faster than hot water. The rate of heating of a liquid depends on the magnitude of the temperature difference between the liquid and its surroundings (the flame on the stove, for instance). As a result, cold water will be absorbing heat faster while it is still cold; once it gets up to the temperature of hot water, the heating rate slows down and from there it takes just as long to bring it to a boil as the water that was hot to begin with. Because it takes cold water some time to reach the temperature of hot water, cold water clearly takes longer to boil than hot water does. There may be some psychological effect at play; cold water starts boiling sooner than one might expect because of the aforementioned greater heat absorption rate when water is colder. 


It even suggests you try it out yourself:


  You can readily set up an experiment to learn which freezes earlier: water that is initially hot, or water that is initially cold. Use a given setting on an electric hot plate and clock the time between start and boiling for a given pot containing, say, one quart of water; first start with the water as cold as the tap will provide and then repeat it with the hottest water available from that tap. I'd wager the quart of water initially hot will come to a boil in much less time than the quart of water initially cold.

Did the British navy fail to take into account the ballistics correction due to Coriolis force during WW1 Falkland Islands battle?,No. It is a complete invention of an urban myth.

Unless anybody produces a Royal Navy document that even does any mention of this influence of Coriolis effect, this seems to be just untrue. A complete fabrication for a good story – good for teaching physics but very bad history. 

It seems to be an annoying urban myth. The Coriolis effect is present and significant for shots at long ranges and flight duration. But it is not the only factor involved and naval gunners did not rely on tables alone. The Coriolis effect for any gun on any ship at any latitude in any direction is a constant influence on accuracy if shooting continues into the same direction.

Further, the observations made during peacetime were not made for this range and speed at all. The only time approaching this range was made on the Southern hemisphere en route to the Falklands and the ships involved did a run of gunnery practice the day before the battle. Any systematic error that big as claimed would have surfaced by then and dealt with accordingly.

Such systematic errors should be quickly spotted and corrected for as long as the targets are still visible, that is: above the horizon if spotting is to be done from the same ship that is firing.

This myth is entirely absent from all history books I checked on for this battle. It is also missing from German accounts of the events, as evidenced by how German Wikipedia narrates the analysis:


  During the battle, the two British battle cruisers fired the considerable quantity of almost 1200 305 mm grenades at the German armoured cruisers, which allows conclusions to be drawn about the training of the operators and the quality of the grenades. However, the Royal Navy did not draw any conclusions from this circumstance until after the Battle of Skagerrak one and a half years later.


A more specialised Wiki has its own entry on Coriolis effect and on the page related to the battle puts it this way:


  Coriolis Effect
  An annoying urban legend persists that the Royal Navy's shooting at the Battle of the Falklands was poor due to their equipment applying corrections for Coriolis effect in the wrong direction, as the action was in the southern hemisphere rather than the northern. The truth is, however, that no contemporary aspect of Royal Navy equipment or procedure took Coriolis effect into consideration, an extremely minor deficiency. For, even if the fable were true, if the action took place on a nearly constant bearing, and at a range that changed only slowly, even a blatant mistreatment of Coriolis effect such as its negative consideration would therefore have been a constant error, and one unlikely to be large compared to other factors affecting the proper deflection to use (such as the zig-zagging of a fleeing enemy). This fact implies that the remedy for such a miscue would have been a single spotting correction for deflection which, once made, would counteract the error for the remainder of the action.
  While I think it likely that later systems of firing incorporated Coriolis corrections, a system lacking such treatment which is designed primarily to bring fire upon a maneuvering enemy is not a sad system by any means. Taken in context, Coriolis errors are a constant source of deflection error and very small in degree. The need to fire repeated salvoes which for many reasons will require spotting to put them onto the target implies that a failure to handle Coriolis effect, or even handle it entirely backwards, would not prevent a shooter from hitting his target in a prolonged engagement.


And the British Royal Navy summarises, without ever mentioning "Coriolis":


  System 1914
  
  
  In the year 1914 a high standard of efficiency in the control of fire was attained; the system used was thoroughly understood and there was no lack of confidence in the ability of the fire control system to compete successfully with the accepted standards of range and general battle conditions.
  Briefly, the rangefinder equipment was used to feed the fire control gear, and the latter was relied upon to furnish the requisite information for successful attack on a moving target. In conjunction with this, the bracket system of spotting was universally used to correct the best mean range into the actual gun range after opening fire.
  
  
  The correction of the remaining factors, such as rate and deflection, was primarily dependent upon observation of fire, although great importance was attached to the use of the fire control gear as a guide.
  
  Battle Experience   
  
  
  The earliest engagements of the war gave no cause to suspect that the firing rules were inadequate to deal with battle conditions.
  The Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1914, fought in very low visibility was not of a character to produce any reliable evidence one way or another. It showed, however -
  The impossibility of taking ranges in low visibility conditions.
  The action off the Falkland Islands in the same year demonstrated the following:
  
  
  The rangefinder equipment failed to provide much information. (This was chiefly due to the range at which the action was fought, which outclassed the 9-ft rangefinders.)
  The use of defensive tactics (zigzagging) rendered the control of fire extremely difficult, and placed a high premium on rapidity of fire as soon as the gun range was found.
  
  
  
  USE OF 100-YARD CORRECTIONS
  
  
  Reports were called for at the end of 1932 regarding the desirability of limiting the occasions on which corrections of 100 yards for range are permissible, in view of the frequent occasions on which range spotting corrections are insufficiently bold.
  As a result of these reports it was not considered that a case had been made out for altering the existing rules, but it was stressed that control officers must constantly bear in mind the necessity for the use of bold spotting corrections, especially when aircraft are not available for spotting.

  Of Progress In Naval Gunnery, 1914-1936, Training And Staff Duties Division, Naval Staff, Admiralty, S.W., December, 1936.
  


It is curious for the claim to only focus on the battle at the Falklands. As for the previous battle at Coronel, also on the Southern hemisphere, the outcome was similar. And again at Jutland, this time on the supposedly 'correct' hemisphere for correctly calibrated Coriolis compensation: the British range finding and gun aiming was just inferior. (As the German ships had similar conditions, from perfect manoeuvre-like  going over to smoke-induced blindness at high-speed, but remaining at a better hit-rate)

As books focusing just on that specific battle alone never mention Coriolis effect, a work that analysis just the history of naval gunnery and aiming techniques concludes:


  The rangefinder measured the geometric range between shooter and target, which was sometimes called the true range. Given rangefinder errors, this measurement could not be entirely accurate, but it is convenient to identify the rangefinder figure with the actual distance between ship and target. This range was not the same as the gun range, the range to which sights should be set. Gun range took into account the movement of the target while the shell was in the air and even that of the shooter while the shell was in the gun (where it shared the ship’s motion). It thus involved knowledge of how the range was changing: the range rate. The longer the range (ie, the more time the shell spent in the air), the more significant the range rate. At very long range, factors such as the rotation of the earth had to be taken into account. It began to matter that a ship was able to measure her own speed. That was difficult: only in about 1912 did the Royal Navy obtain an electric log (measuring speed). Other navies were probably in about the same position: the Germans license-produced the British log. 
  
  The British were fairly sure, moreover, that their understanding of gunnery was far in advance of any other navy: in 1906 DNO’s assistant Captain Harding remarked that foreign navies did not yet understand the difference between geometric and gun range. Only recently had British officers realised how important it was to know the geometric range precisely, rather than depend on spotting beginning with an approximate range. Presumably this referred partly to Captain W C Pakenham’s comments during the Russo-Japanese War (Pakenham was Royal Naval attaché to Japan at the time): ‘Outside the Service the impossibility of continuous use of the rangefinder and therefore the importance of a knowledge of the rate of change [range rate] is not recognised, consequently the means of its determination are unsought for.’ No one had tried to make a rangefinder record its output automatically, and no one (apart from Pollen, see chapter 2) had realised the importance of using a gyro to eliminate yaw from rangefinder bearing readings. The Germans were probably the most advanced foreign navy at this time. Little was known of their thinking, but the evidence of what they were using (sextants with a few unmodified Barr &amp; Stroud rangefinders) and of articles in their main annual publication, Nauticus, suggested that they were not working along British lines.
  
  The range rate
  Successful gunnery required that the position of the target be projected ahead, ultimately to the moment at which a shell might be expected to hit. To do that, the shooter had to calculate the rates at which the range and bearing of the target changed; they were usually called the range and bearing rates. Calculation was difficult because neither was constant, and because each depended on the other. Alternatively, one might think in terms of the vector (magnitude and direction) pointing from shooter to target. The change in this vector was another vector which might be called the rate vector. It could be expressed as two components, one along the line of fire and one across it. The rate along was usually called the range rate. The rate across was usually called deflection. Its magnitude was the bearing rate multiplied by the range.
  
  The Falklands
  In December 1914 two British battlecruisers fought Admiral Graf von Spee’s Pacific Squadron, which had recently sunk the HMS Good Hope at Coronel. This time visibility was excellent (only in the last hour of the battle did it fall to 15,000 yards), and both squadrons steamed at high speed. Neither British ship had a functioning director or a Dreyer Table. Both ships found their fire control hampered by funnel smoke, so that although her fore conning tower and A turret never lost sight of the enemy, in Invincible the fore top occasionally lost sight, and P, Q, and X turrets were much affected. Rangefinding was very difficult due to the long range, funnel smoke, splashes and spray from the enemy. Rate-keeping was difficult at best, due to the enemy’s zigzagging as well as to the very long range (variations in range were almost undetectable). Gunners found it difficult to stay on a point of aim, sometimes mistaking the target’s bow for her stern. On the other hand, according to prisoners, British shells performed well, penetrating and exploding deep in the ships. Even so, Gneisenau took fifty 12in hits before sinking. It was no great surprise that the British ships used up most of their ammunition: one 12in gun in Inflexible fired 109 rounds (the ship was designed to carry eighty for that gun).
  
  To the surprise of the British, von Spee’s ships zigzagged to avoid being hit, even thought that made hits by their own guns unlikely. As crack gunnery ships, the Germans were expected to fire at maximum range, but the actual figure for their 8.2in guns, 16,000 yards, seems to have surprised the British. The Germans straddled (without hitting) at 15,000 yards. The Germans persistently fired salvoes (the British thought, wrongly, that they were using directors), and their direction and fire discipline were excellent. The British were impressed by the effect of plunging shells at such ranges, and by the blast effect of the German fire. The German survivors stressed, and the British noted, that slow British fire made it easier for their own gunlayers. It also made spotting easier, because the British ships were much less completely enveloped in the smoke of their own guns. This may have been the first of many British observations that their firing techniques were far too deliberate.

Further reports include 


  Excessive smoke was not the only cause of the slow, inaccurate gunfire of the battle cruisers. A British officer in the spotting top of Invincible, Lieutenant Commander Hubert Dannreuther, who happened to be a godson of the composer Richard Wagner, found that his excellent, German-made stereoscopic rangefinder was rendered useless not only by smoke, but also by the vibration caused by the ship’s high speed, and by the violent shaking of the mast whenever A turret fired. In Invincible’s P turret, conditions were impossible. The gun layers could see nothing except enemy gun flashes through enveloping clouds of smoke, and every time Q turret, across the deck, fired over them, everyone in P turret was deafened and dazed by the blast. On Inflexible, Lieutenant Commander Rudolf Verner in the battle cruiser’s foretop was almost the only man aboard his ship who could judge the location of the enemy, and he, handicapped by the smoke from the flagship ahead, had great difficulty observing what damage his gunners were causing. [...]  
  
  From Invincible’s spotting top, Dannreuther reported, “She was being torn apart and was blazing and it seemed impossible that anyone could still be alive.” On Inflexible, Verner, astounded by the continuing salvos from the German armored cruisers, ordered his crews to fire “rapid independent,” with the result that at one point, P turret had three shells in the air at the same time, all of which were seen to land on or near the target. Yet the German fire continued. “We were most obviously hitting [Scharnhorst,] but I could not stop her firing. [...] I remember asking my rate operator, ‘What the devil can we do?’ ”[...]
  
  There were many reasons for what at first sight seemed inefficient ship handling and inept gunnery in the British squadron. Before the war, few British naval officers had appreciated the inherent inaccuracy of naval guns at long range. The only time that Lieutenant Commander Dannreuther, the gunnery officer of Invincible, had been allowed to fire at ranges in excess of 6,000 yards was during the practice authorized by Sturdee on the way south to the Falklands—and he had been gunnery officer of the battle cruiser since 1912. Nor had peacetime practice disclosed the difficulties of shooting accurately from a rapidly moving platform at a rapidly moving target. Further, no one had considered that when ships were traveling at high speed, the intense vibration created by engines and propellers might rattle and blur the gun layers’ and trainers’ telescopes. Nor had prewar maneuvers revealed the obscuring effects of billowing funnel smoke at high speed. As the war went on, the expected rate of shells fired to hits achieved became 5 percent. That was approximately the ratio in the Falklands, but at this early time in the war, everyone expected better and therefore it seemed a failure.

To correct a few of the invented history details of the physics teacher, the report of a gunnery officer gives:


  
    Primary Control from Fore Top was used throughout. At times the control was very difficult as we were firing down wind the whole time and the view from aloft was much interfered with by gun smoke and funnel smoke. Range Finders were of little use and any form of range finder plotting was impossible owing to the difficulty of observation and high range. 
    
    In fact as far as this particular action was concerned it would have made no difference if the ship had not had a single Range Finder or Dumaresq or any plotting outfit on board.
    
    During the latter part of the action with the Gneisenau (she) continually zig-zagged to try to avoid being hit, altering course every few minutes about two points either side of her normal course. This alteration of course could not be detected by Range Finder or by eye and continual spotting corrections were necessary. The rate being fairly high and changing every few minutes from opening to closing I found the only effective means was to keep the rate at zero and continually spot on the target. By this means we managed to hit her now and again.
     -- Quoted from Richard Hough: "Falklands 1914: The Pursuit of Admiral Von Spee", Periscope Publishing, 2003.
  


And finally, the first shots being fired by the British did not land sideways to the target. They were just a bit too short at their maximum range of 16,500 yards:


  At 1247hrs, Sturdee hoisted the signal ‘Engage the enemy’ and eight minutes later Inflexible opened fire with her forward turret, sending two 12in. shells arcing towards Leipzig at a range of 16,500 yards. The shells fell considerably short, but a few minutes later Invincible began her participation in the battle with a salvo that landed a mere thousand yards short of their target and soon the battle cruisers’ gunnery officers, Hubert Dannreuther and Rudolf Verner were calling out near misses as the German light cruiser was straddled by towering waterspouts.

A similar assessment of the claim is found at The continued badhistory of Neil deGrasse Tyson: This time, it's the slightly esoteric field of WW1 naval fire control.

The source 

The origin of this myth can be traced back to admitted hearsay by John Littlewood in 1953 (who is – in non-history science-related papers  even said to have served as a gunner in the war):


  I heard an account of the battle of the Falkland Islands  (early in the 1914 war) from an officer who was there. The  German ships were destroyed at extreme range, but it took  a long time and salvos were continually falling 100 yards to  the left. The effect of the rotation of the earth is similar to  'drift' and was similarly incorporated in the gun-sights. 
  But this involved the tacit assumption that Naval battles  take place round about latitude 50 N. The double difference  for 50 S. and extreme range is of the order of 100 yards.     
  
  Various attempts of mine to set this in examinations failed. ' I had hoped to draw the criticism of unreality', to which there is the following reply. In 1917-18, a range table was called for, for* the first time, and quickly, for a gun in an aeroplane flying at a fixed height, to fire in all directions. A method existed, based on numerical calculation of the vertically upward and vertically downward trajectories. It happened that within the permissible limits of accuracy the values of A and p could be faked to make A--JU, (and downward trajectory could accordingly be read off from a table of sines, and the range table was in fact made in this way (in about two-thirds 1 the time it would otherwise have taken).
  
  I do not deny that the example just given is slightly disreputable...

During the war


  In World War I Littlewood served in the Royal Garrison Artillery. His contributions were highly significant and special allowances were made to keep him happy, such as letting him live with friends in London, and to carry an umbrella when in uniform! Littlewood himself described this war work in 'J E Littlewood, Adventures in ballistics, 1915-1918'. The result was that he improved the accuracy of anti-aircraft range tables and improved the formulae for finding the range, the time of flight and the angle of descent at the end of a trajectory with small elevation.
  
  E A Milne has described how Littlewood was able to discover techniques which greatly reduced the amount of work needed for making these accurate calculation of missile trajectories. Trials were conducted to see if the results of Littlewood's predictions held in practice and, Milne writes:-
  
  
    ... to the astonishment and joy of all concerned the observed positions of the shellbursts fell exactly on Littlewood's trajectories, at the correct time-markings, within very small errors of observation.
  
  
  –– St Andrews Biographies: John Edensor Littlewood


This unreliable anecdote seems from 1953 onwards to gain little traction, but slowly found its way from lectures into mathematics and physics textbooks in the following years.



Modern handbooks of artillery simply state to ignore Coriolis for distances of less than 10–20 km 


  When firing at distances beyond 10 km the Coriolis’ force must be included as its contribution may exceed more than one per cent of the range of the rocket. However, there are no principal difficulties with the inclusion of this force in the equations. The trajectory calculation will consequently depend on the latitude of the firing post and the azimuthal direction of fire. In order to include this force a three-dimensional model must be applied.
  –– Ove Dullum: "The Rocket Artillery Reference Book" Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI), 2010.) 


Or simply


  Projectiles, which travel great distances, are subject to the Coriolis force. This is actually not a force at all, but an apparent acceleration caused the Earth’s rotation. The local frame of reference (north, east, south and west) must rotate as the Earth does. The amount of rotation, also known as the earth rate is dependent on the latitude:
  
  earth rate = (2π radians)/(24 hours) × sin(latitude).
  
  For example, at 30 N, the earth rate is 0.13 radians/hr (3.6 x 10 rad/sec).
  
  As the frame of reference moves under the projectile that is traveling in a straight line, it appears to be deflected in a direction opposite to the rotation of the frame of reference.
  
  In the Northern Hemisphere, the trajectory will be deflected to the right. A projectile traveling 1000 m/s due north at latitude 30 N would be accelerated to the right at 0.07 m/s . For a 30 second time-of-flight, corresponding to about 30-km total distance traveled, the projectile would be deflected by about 60 m. So for long range artillery, the Coriolis correction is quite important. On the other hand, for bullets and water going down the drain, it is insignificant!
  
  –– Craig M. Payne: "Principles of Naval Weapons Systems", US Naval Academy, 2000


If you want to re-calculate the exact amount of deflection that would have been attributable to Coriolis effct at the Falklands:

The problem as presented in courses at Harvard (PDF):


  
  The Coriolis Force
  
  
  Deflection due to Coriolis force is given by ∆y = (∆x)2 Ω sin(λ) / v, where v is the speed, λ is the latitude, ∆x is the distance traveled, and Ω is the angular velocity of the Earth (7.3x10-5 s-1).
  
  (a) Find the displacement of a snowball thrown 10m at 30 km/h in Cambridge (latitude 42°N). (2 points)    
  
  ∆y = ((10m)2 * 7.3x10-5 s-1 * sin(42°))/(3.0x104/(60*60) m s-1)
  
  ∆y = 5.9x10-4 m = 0.59mm

Are nebulae colored?,From HubbleSite - Behind The Pictures:

The Meaning of Color


  
  
  The colors in Hubble images, which are assigned for various reasons, aren't always what we'd see if we were able to visit the imaged objects in a spacecraft. 
  
  We often use color as a tool, whether it is to enhance an object's detail or to visualize what ordinarily could never be seen by the human eye.




Example: The Eagle Nebula


  
  
  Note:
  The three B&amp;W images each correspond to a certain wavelength (=color).
  
  
    
  
  
  
  Left: Oxygen - Green
  Middle: Hydrogen - Red
  Right: Sulfur - Red
  
  
  Each of these B&amp;W images are then (re-)assigned a unique color, because otherwise the red light from hydrogen and that from sulfur would be hard to tell apart.




Choosing Colors


  




Why are the inital images B&amp;W?


  The digital camera you have at home basically works the same way: Light is "converted" into electrons.
  
  From Panasonic:
  
  
    Since a CCD can only distinguish whether light is strong or weak, color filters are used to obtain each color's light and dark information.
  
  
  
  
  (I modified the above picture to make it more clear)
  
  One can see that the yellow flower emits more in red and green (light) and less in blue (dark).
  
   [RGB Color Model on Wikipedia]




Hubble's Color Filters


  Hubble uses special filters to "screen out" the types of light from an object that astronomers are not currently studying. 
  
  These filters allow only a certain range of light wavelengths through. Once the unwanted light has been filtered out, the resulting light is allowed to fall onto one or more light-sensitive detectors.
  
  
  
  This produces a "picture" of the star in the selected wavelength. 
  
  Since the detectors can detect light outside the visible light spectrum, the use of filters allows scientists to see "invisible" objects — those only visible in ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths.

As to your question to how reasonable the policy is;


Do you want to be the person who puts their hand up and be responsible for the deaths of a bunch of school kids (even if statistics say its unlikely, it plays on the mind).
It's possible insurance companies would not pay up in this circumstance.
There may be council regulations or other policies which sit at a higher level, so it's not the choice of the school or the operator of the pool.

Is breaking bricks/wood "karate style" an impressive feat?,Cecil Adams of the Straight Dope is a noted skeptic and debunker of myths, and was asked about this one

He read a paper:


  "The Physics of Karate Strikes" by Jon Chananie at the University of Virginia.  


that in turn cited physicist Jearl Walker - probably section 1.45 of his book The Flying Circle of Physics.

He then anecdotally describes using this knowledge (and other research) to give it a go, and in his first session was splitting 5 boards. A younger assistant could split 3.

As Cecil Adams is not a martial artist, it seems that the skill is more about knowing how than concentration or special strength.

Is the F-35 aircraft literally invisible?,According to Business Insider (which interviewed retired Marine Maj. Dan Flatley, former F-35 pilot):  


  Today, Russia and China have built impressive arrays of very high frequency, or VHF, and other integrated radars that  can spot even the US's most advanced and stealthy jets  like the F-22 and the F-35 under the right circumstances.  


...  


  Russian VHF radars can spot F-35s 


... 


  "That's the thing people don't understand," Flatley said. "They think we're saying we're invisible to everyone all the time, at all bandwidths and energy levels. ... That's not what we're saying."

Does the Karpen Pile work, producing continuous energy without refueling?,This probably isn't a "proof" answer like you're asking in the question, but aside from the "we can't put it into an exposition because we can't afford security" line it sounds suspicious as hell -- not to mention similar to the Oxford Bell which has a number of similar characteristics and most definitely isn't an infinite energy source, merely a very efficient battery delivering a very small charge to keep something very simple running...

Can airport X-ray machines scramble Kindle screens?,Likely not (beyond the normal static shock associated with rubber conveyor belts).

I can bring two pieces of evidence I find convincing even though not as definitive as a full blown experiment:


This video which shows a Kindle safely going through an X-Ray machine at an airport without damage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBg_5G2YEDg
The expert opinion of Professor Daping Chu, Head of the Photonics &amp; Sensors Group in the Electrical Engineering Division, Cambridge University Engineering Department.


  “I don’t think the radiation used in an airport scanner would ever be strong enough to damage an electronic ink display,” said Professor Daping Chu, Chairman of the University of Cambridge centre for Advanced Photonics. "But you can get a build up of static inside these machines, caused by the rubber belt rubbing. If that charge were to pass through a Kindle, it’s conceivable that it could damage the screen.”

Does plutonium exist in the world, apart from being manufactured?,The Royal Society of Chemistry states:


  Plutonium was first made in December 1940 at Berkeley, California, by Glenn Seaborg, Arthur Wahl, Joseph Kennedy, and Edwin McMillan. They produced it by bombarding uranium-238 with deuterium nuclei (alpha particles). This first produced neptunium-238 with a half-life of two days, and this decayed by beta emission to form element 94 (plutonium). Within a couple of months element 94 had been conclusively identified and its basic chemistry shown to be like that of uranium.
  To begin with, the amounts of plutonium produced were invisible to the eye, but by August 1942 there was enough to see and weigh, albeit only 3 millionths of a gram. However, by 1945 the Americans had several kilograms, and enough plutonium to make three atomic bombs, one of which exploded over Nagasaki in August 1945


The US effort to build a nuclear bomb got the name Manhattan project no earlier than 1941*, so there is no contradiction there.

But plutonium does exist in nature (note that you are not asking about a specific isotope), as is e.g. shown in The Occurrence of Plutonium in Nature by Charles A. Levine and Glenn T. Seaborg (PDF avalable here):


  Plutonium has been chemically separated from seven different ores and the ratios of plutonium to uranium determined. This ratio was found to be fairly constant (approx. 10-11) in pitchblende and monazite ores, ...


In his autobiography (G.T. Seaborg and E. Seaborg - Adventures in the atomic age: from Watts to Washington), Seaborg says more about the naming of Plutonium:


  It was so difficult to make, from such rare materials, that we thought it would be the heaviest element ever formed. So we considered names like extremium and ultimium. Fortunately, we were spared the inevitable embarrassment that one courts when proclaiming a discovery to be the ultimate in any field by deciding to follow the nomenclatural precedents of the two prior elements.
  A new planet had been discovered in 1781 and, like the rest of the planets, named for a Greek or Roman deity-Uranus. A scientist who discovered a heavy new element eight years later named it after the planet: uranium. The planet Neptune was discovered in 1846, so Ed McMillan followed this precedent and named element 93 neptunium. Conveniently for us, the final planet, Pluto, had been discovered in 1930. We briefly considered the form plutium, but plutonium seemed more euphonious.


So the element has existed since the formation of the Earth (and maybe earlier), but a) it was not known before December 1940 and b) it did not have the name plutonium.

* I cannot find the exact date. As mentioned in this NY Times Article, that information is in the book The Manhattan Project: The Birth of the Atomic Bomb in the Words of Its Creators, Eyewitnesses, and Historians by Cynthia C. Kelly

Can bullets fired into the air kill a person when they fall?,As for physics, it is really very simple, the kinetic energy is converted to a potential energy while climbing and then to kinetic again when falling, with some of it converted to a heat due to friction. The air friction is quite substantial, the landing velocity, which is reported to be in range 50-200 m/s, is significantly lower than muzzle velocity, which is usually 300-1000 m/s, but the velocity is still high enough to kill.

Celebratory gunfire - plenty of statistics and examples. My favourite: "every bullet that is fired up, must come down".


  People are injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down. The mortality rate among those struck by falling bullets is about 32%, compared with about 2% to 6% normally associated with gunshot wounds. The higher mortality is related to the higher incidence of head wounds from falling bullets.
  
  For example, in one study led by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), they found that 80% of celebratory gunfire-related injuries are to the head, feet, and shoulders. In the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, about two people die and about 25 more are injured each year from celebratory gunfire on New Year's Eve, the CDC says. Between the years of 1985 and 1992, doctors at the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, treated some 118 people for random falling-bullet injuries. Thirty-eight Kuwaitis celebrating in 1991 at the end of the Gulf War by firing weapons into the air caused 20 deaths from falling bullets.
  
  Firearms expert Julian Hatcher has studied falling bullets and found that on average .30 caliber rounds reach terminal velocities of 300 feet per second (90 m/s) and larger .50 caliber bullets have a terminal velocity of 500 feet per second (150 m/s). A bullet traveling at only 150 feet per second (46 m/s) to 170 feet per second (52 m/s) can easily penetrate human skin and at 200 feet per second (60 m/s), that same bullet can penetrate the skull.  Even a bullet that does not penetrate the skull may still result in an intracranial injury.

Can the useful lifespan of razor blades be extended by stroking them over jeans?,I am a knifemaker in New Zealand so I have some experience with blades. I can tell you that with a normal knife stropping is commonly used to prolong the edge of the knife as Rob Z stated before me. 
It is also used to get the burr off a freshly sharpened blade. This is achieved by stroking the blade at a low angle with the spine leading along a soft material. The palm of your hand is a common one and is suprisingly effective. Canvas, denim and leather are a few others. This does not sharpen the blade but re-aligns the edge. 

I doubt you could achieve much on the multi bladed shaving razors as you need to have access to both edges but the theory is there. 

What the guy in the instructable is talking about is based on what I have mentioned above but will not work, jeans will never sharpen razor blades no matter how many times you stroke them. His tips about keeping them dry and clean is very true though. 
Stopping blades from rusting is my biggest concern. Even if they say they are stainless they will still rust enough to destroy the edge very quickly.

Stropping your kitchen knives (a knife steel is a form of strop) and straight razors is a very good idea, trying to strop your shaving razor is waste of time.
Keep them clean and dry and you will get more life out of them.
